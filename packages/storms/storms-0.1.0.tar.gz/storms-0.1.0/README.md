## Features

- Download hourly rainfall timeseries from [NOAA ISD](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/land-based-station/integrated-surface-database) 
- Bin rainfall data timeseries into descrete events
- Develop a partial duration series of rainfall from metorologically independent events for any duration
- Calculate the ARI of historical events at various timeseries using GEV or plotting position
- Interpolate NOAA Atlas 14 ARI for events based on station location and event depth
- Provide pandas DataFrame interface to all these data
