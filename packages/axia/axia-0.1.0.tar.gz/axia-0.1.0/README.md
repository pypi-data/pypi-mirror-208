-----------------

The axia package provides an implementation of an extension  of
the Shifted-Beta-Geometric model by P. Fader & B. Hardie [1] to individuals in
contractual settings with multiple predictor variables.

It will soon provide a lot more...

Axia offers a survival analysis like approach to modeling the
behaviour of individuals in contractual settings. Given a set of features, ages
and status (alive or dead), this package builds on top of the model developed
by P. Fader & B. Hardie [1], to infer hazard curves, retention curves and
discounted-life-time-value.

Head over to the examples folder to learn how to use axia.
