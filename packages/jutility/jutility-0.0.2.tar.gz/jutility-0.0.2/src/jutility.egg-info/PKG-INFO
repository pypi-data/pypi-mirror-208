## Updating package on PyPI

This package was uploaded to PyPI following [the Packaging Python Projects tutorial in the official Python documentation](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/).

To update PyPI with a newer version, update the `version` tag in [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml), and then use the following commands:

```
python -m build
python -m twine upload dist/*
```

When prompted by `twine`, enter `__token__` as the username, and paste an API token from the [PyPI account management webpage](https://pypi.org/manage/account/) as the password (including the `pypi-` prefix).
