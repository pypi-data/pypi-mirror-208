    @Description:       This file contains the PatientsDataGenerator class which is used to iterate on multiple
                        patients' dicom files and segmentation files using the PatientDataReader to obtain all patients'
                        data. The PatientsDataGenerator inherits from the Generator abstract class.

        Used to get the paths to the images and segmentations folders. Also used to check if either the series

        Parameters
        ----------
        path_to_patients_folder : str
            The path to the folder that contains all the patients' folders.
        series_descriptions : Optional[Union[str, Dict[str, List[str]]]], default = None.
            A dictionary that contains the series descriptions of the images that needs to be extracted from the
            patient's file. Keys are arbitrary names given to the images we want to add and values are lists of
            series descriptions. The images associated with these series descriptions do not need to have a
            corresponding segmentation. Note that it can be specified as a path to a json dictionary that contains the
            series descriptions.
        transforms : Union[Compose, DataTransform, MonaiMapTransform, PhysicalSpaceTransform]
            A sequence of transformations to apply. PhysicalSpaceTransform are applied in the physical space, i.e on
            the SimpleITK image, while MonaiMapTransform are applied in the array space, i.e on the numpy array that
            represents the image. DataTransform transforms the data using other a patient's other images or
            segmentations. The keys for images are assumed to be the arbitrary series key set in 'series_descriptions'.
            For segmentation, keys are organ names. Note that if 'series_descriptions' is None, the keys for images are
            assumed to be modalities.
        erase_unused_dicom_files: bool = False
