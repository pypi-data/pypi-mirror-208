**Hsuanwu: Long-Term Evolution Project of Reinforcement Learning** is inspired by the long-term evolution (LTE) standard project in telecommunications, which aims to track the latest research progress in reinforcement learning (RL) and provide stable and efficient baselines. In Hsuanwu, you can find everything you need in RL, such as training, evaluation, deployment, etc. The highlight features of Hsuanwu:

- ⏱️ Latest algorithms and tricks;
- 🧱 Highly modularized design for complete decoupling of RL algorithms;
- 🚀 Optimized workflow for full hardware acceleration;
- ⚙️ Support for custom environments;
- 🖥️ Support for multiple computing devices like GPU and NPU;
- 🛠️ Support for RL model engineering deployment (TensorRT, CANN, ...);
- 💾 Large number of reusable bechmarks ([See HsuanwuHub](https://hub.hsuanwu.dev/));
- 📋 Elegant experimental management powered by [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/).

Hsuanwu ([Xuanwu, 玄武](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xuanwu_(god))) is one of the Four Symbols of the Chinese constellations, representing the north and the winter season. It is usually depicted as a turtle entwined together with a snake. Since turtles are very long-lived, we use this name to symbolize the long-term and influential development of the project.
