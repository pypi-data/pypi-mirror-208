## Overview

Nikefy will allow users to quickly access metadata from Nike.com website such as products and prices data.

* Create a database that easily queries shoes
* Easily find sold out products
* Find out most popular products via ratings

## Install

```
pip install nikefy
```

# Usage
```python
import nikefy as nf

url = 'https://www.nike.com/w/mens-shoes-nik1zy7ok'
nf.get_nike_products(url)
nike_products = nf.get_nike_products(url)
sorted_nike_products = sort_nike_products(nike_products, sort_order='asc')
filtered_nike_products = filter_nike_products(nike_products, price_range=(100, 150), product_type="Men's Shoes")
```

`get_nike_products()` gets Men's shoes products from Nike.com website and returns a dataframe

`sort_nike_products()` sorts Men's shoes products based on price

`filter_nike_products()` filters Men's shoes based on price range and type

# Example
Running the following code
```python
import nikefy as nf

url = 'https://www.nike.com/w/mens-shoes-nik1zy7ok'
nike_products = nf.get_nike_products(url)
print(nike_products)
```
Outputs something like this to the console
