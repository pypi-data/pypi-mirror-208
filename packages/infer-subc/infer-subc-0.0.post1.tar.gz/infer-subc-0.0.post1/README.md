## About The Project

`infer_subc` 
- aims to create a simple, extensible, and reproducible workflow to measure (or infer) the shape, position, size, and interaction of several sub-cellular components. These data can then be applied later to better understand the spatial coordination of these structures and the interactome during key biological processes.

- is part of a larger collaboration between the CZI Neurodegeneration Challenge Network [(NDCN)](https://chanzuckerberg.com/science/programs-resources/neurodegeneration-challenge/) Data Science Concierge program and the Cohen lab at UNC [(website,](https://cohenlaboratory.web.unc.edu/) [github)](https://github.com/SCohenLab) to migrate a multispectral imaging dataset of iPSCs which identifies sub-cellular components to a scalable cloud-based pipeline.  



## `infer_subc` Workflow

The staring point of this workflow is a set of multichannel images, where each channel labels a different sub-cellular component. The workflow can then be completed in a _**suggested**_ series of steps, outlined in the notebooks below.

**Identify a single cell of interest**

1. [Infer cellmask](./notebooks/01_infer_cellmask.ipynb) (ðŸš¨ Steps 2-9 depend on establishing a good solution here)
2. [Infer nuclei ](./notebooks/02_infer_nuclei.ipynb)
3. [Infer cytoplasm](./notebooks/03_infer_cytoplasm.ipynb) 

**Segment each of the organelles**

4. [Infer lysosomes](./notebooks/04_infer_lysosome.ipynb)
5. [Infer mitochondria](./notebooks/05_infer_mitochondria.ipynb)
6. [Infer golgi complex](./notebooks/06_infer_golgi.ipynb)
7. [Infer peroxisomes](./notebooks/07_infer_peroxisome.ipynb)
8. [Infer endoplasmic reticulum](./notebooks/08_infer_endoplasmic_reticulum.ipynb)
9. [Infer lipid bodies](./notebooks/09_infer_lipid_body.ipynb) 

## Built With

A quick note on tools and resources used.

- [`napari-allencell-segmenter`](https://github.com/AllenCell/napari-allencell-segmenter) -- We are leveraging the framework of the `napari-allencell-segmenter` plugin, which enables powerful 3D image segmentation while taking advantage of the `napari` graphical user interface. 
- [`aicssegmentation`](https://github.com/AllenCell/aics-segmentation) -- We call the `aicssegmentation` package directly.
- [`napari`](https://napari.org/stable/) -- Used as the visualization framework, a fast, interactive, multi-domensional image viewer for Python.
- [`scipy`](https://scipy.org/install/) -- Image analysis
- [`scikit-image`](https://scikit-image.org/) -- Image analysis
- [`itk`](https://itkpythonpackage.readthedocs.io/en/master/Quick_start_guide.html) -- Image analysis
- [`numpy`](https://numpy.org/) -- Under the hood computation
- [`Alzheimer's Disease AD Workbench`](https://www.alzheimersdata.org/ad-workbench) -- We initially wanted to use the ADDI's ADWB as a method of data sharing and to serve as a computational resource.

## ADWB hints

Given that the github repos are not yet whitelisted, the source directory needs to be zipped and uploaded in order to make an "editable" pip install.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The following are prerequisites and should be installed prior to using the workflow.

- `napari` 
  ```
  pip install "napari[all]"
  ```

- `scipy`
  ```
  python -m pip install scipy
  ```

- `scikit-image`
  ```
  pip install scikit-image
  ```

- `itk`
  ```
  pip install itk
  ```
- `numpy`
  ```
  pip install numpy
  ```

### Installation

`infer_subc` is not yet available on `PyPI` so must be  be `pip` ionstalled from source
```
pip install git+https://github.com/ndcn/infer-subc.git
```

## Usage

```py
from infer_subc.organelles import infer_lyso
from infer_subc.core.file_io import read_czi_image

img_data,meta_dict = read_czi_image("path/to/image.czi")
lyso_obj =  infer_lyso(img_data) 

```

 ðŸš§ WIP ðŸš§ (ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ )
> NOTE: command line capabilities not implimented
```bash
$ python -m infer_subc
#or
$ infer_subc
```

## Roadmap

 - [ ] Create `PyPI` package
 - [ ] Update installation instructions to reflect optimal use of `conda` environments
