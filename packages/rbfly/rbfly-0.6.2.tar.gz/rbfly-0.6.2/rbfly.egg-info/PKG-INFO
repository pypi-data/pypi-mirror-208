RbFly is a library for RabbitMQ Streams using Python asyncio

- https://www.rabbitmq.com/streams.html
- https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html

The library is designed and implemented with the following features in mind

1. Simple and flexible API.
2. Use of AMQP 1.0 message format to enable interoperability between
   clients.
3. Performance by implementing critical sections of code using Cython,
   avoiding copying of data, and testing.
4. Auto reconnection to RabbitMQ broker with lazily created connection
   objects.

RbFly library is licensed under terms of GPL license, version 3, see
COPYING file for details. As stated in the license, there is no warranty,
