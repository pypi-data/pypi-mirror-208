"""
Implements the Web Service Transition Language (WeSTL) document format, which is specified at
http://rwcbook.github.io/wstl-spec/.

This format is used to drive the server-side representor pattern, described at
https://github.com/the-hypermedia-project/charter. The WeSTL format exists in two different 'states'. In
its design-time state, it contains the list of all possible state transitions for a Web service. In its runtime state,
it contains the list of the selected transitions for the current resource along with any data associated with that
resource. The design-time document can be used to define all possible transitions including possible arguments for
querying or writing data. The runtime document can be passed to a module in the heaserver.representor package that can
turn the WeSTL document into a representation format (HTML, Collection+JSON, HAL, etc.).

WeSTL documents have the following format:
{
  "wstl": {
    "actions": [...]
    "data": [...]
  }
}
The state transitions are listed in the "actions" property. Runtime WeSTL documents additionally have a "data" property
containing a list of data items. In HEA, the data items are name-value-pair JSON objects. Actions have the following
properties:
{
  "name": the unique name of the state transition. HEA uses the following naming convention:
  <package-name>-<lowercase-HEADesktopObject-class-name>-<verb-phrase-describing-the-state-transition>, for example,
  heaserver-registry-component-get-properties.
  "type": safe or unsafe, depending on whether the state transition will cause data to be written.
  "target": a space separated list of string values that tag the action for a representor to control how it is rendered.
  HEA defines the following target values that are combined to render actions differently:
    cj: for use in Collection+JSON documents. The action will not render in a Collection+JSON document without this tag
    or the cj-template tag (see below).
    item: applies to each item in the data list, for example, renders a separate link for each item.
    list: applies to the whole data list, for example, renders a single link for the entire list.
    cj-template: for rendering as a template in Collection+JSON documents. Use item or list to indicate whether the
      template should apply to the first item in the document or all items in the document (there can be only one
      template per document).
    read: together with item and cj, renders as a link for each item in a Collection+JSON document.
    href: together with item and cj, renders as bare href and rel properties for each item in a Collection+JSON document.
    add: for templates, will populate the default value of a form field with the corresponding WSTL action's value.
  "prompt": text to use in buttons or hyperlinks generated from the action.
  "href": included at runtime, the URL to go to if the link is followed.
  "rel": contains an array of link relation values, as defined in RFC5988 (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5988).
  HEA defines a standard set of relation values with "hea-" and defines the following values:
    hea-opener: a link to the content of an openable HEADesktopObject.
    hea-opener-choices: a link to choices for opening an openable HEADesktopObject.
    hea-context-aws: a link that applies to Amazon Web Services-related contexts.
    hea-default: a default value. It is used together with hea-opener to denote the default choice among opener choices.
    If a value beginning with hea-context- is present, there may be multiple links tagged with this value, one per
      context.
    hea-duplicator: a link to a form to duplicate a HEADesktopObject.
    hea-mover: a link to a form to move a HEADesktopObject from one folder to another.
    hea-properties: a link to a form to edit the properties of a HEADesktopObject.
      mime types: links to the content of an openable HEADesktopObject must include supported MIME types among their
      link relation values.
    hea-actual: a link to an Item's actual value.
    hea-volume: a link to the object's volume.
    hea-account: a link to the object's account, if there is one.
    hea-person: the person associated with this object, if different from the object's owner.
    hea-context-menu: indicates that this link should be included in the object's context menu.
    hea-trash: a link to the trash bin for this object's volume.
  HEA additionally defines the "headata-" prefix, for link hrefs that should be used as template values. An action
  with relation values "headata-destination" will populate a template field with name "destination".
  The one exception is self, which links to itself.
}


This module provides a class and functions for creating WeSTL design-time and run-time documents in JSON format, and
validating those documents.

HEA follows the WeSTL spec with the following exceptions and extensions:
* Action names should use the following convention, all lowercase with dashes between words:
<project_slug>-<heaobject_classname>-<verb_describing_action>, for example, heaobject-registry-component-get-properties.
Failure to follow this convention could result in collisions between your action names and any action names added to
core HEA in the future.
* We extended the runtime document's wstl object with a hea property, whose value must be an object with any of the
following properties:
    * href: the resource URL of the data, usually the request URL.
