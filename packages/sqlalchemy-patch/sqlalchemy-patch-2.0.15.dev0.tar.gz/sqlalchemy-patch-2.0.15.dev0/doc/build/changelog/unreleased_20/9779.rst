    Fixed issue where using additional relationship criteria with the
    :func:`_orm.joinedload` loader option, where the additional criteria itself
    contained correlated subqueries that referred to the joined entities and
    therefore also required "adaption" to aliased entities, would be excluded
    from this adaption, producing the wrong ON clause for the joinedload.
