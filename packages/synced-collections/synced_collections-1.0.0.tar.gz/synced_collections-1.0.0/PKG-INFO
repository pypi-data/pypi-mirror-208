The [**signac** framework](https://signac.io) helps users manage and scale file-based workflows, facilitating data reuse, sharing, and reproducibility.

The **synced_collections** package provides Pythonic abstractions over various underlying data stores, presenting APIs that behave like standard built-in Python collections like dicts.
**synced_collections** form the backbone of **signac**'s data and metadata storage, but may be used just as easily outside of **signac**.
For instance, users wishing to access a JSON file on disk like a dictionary and automatically persist all changes could use the `synced_collections.JSONDict`.

  Framework overview and news.

## Quickstart

This short example demonstrates what you can do with `synced_collections`.

```python
>>> from synced_collections.backends.collection_json import JSONDict
>>> d = JSONDict("data.json")
>>> d["size"] = 10
>>> d["color"] = "blue"
>>> import json
>>> with open("data.json") as f:
...     print(json.load(f))
...
{'size': 10, 'color': 'blue'}
```

## Testing

You can test this package by executing:

```bash
$ python -m pytest tests/
```
