# panda3d-gltf
This project adds glTF loading capabilities to Panda3D.
One long-term goal for this project is to be used as a reference for adding a builtin, C++ glTF loader to Panda3D.
If and when Panda3D gets builtin support for glTF, this module will go into maintenance mode and be used to backport glTF support to older versions of Panda3D.

## Features
* Adds support for native loading of glTF files
* Supports glTF 2.0
* Supports binary glTF
* Includes support for the following extensions:
  * KHR_lights (deprecated in favor of KHR_lights_punctual)
  * KHR_lights_punctual
  * BLENDER_physics
* Ships with a `gltf2bam` cli-tool for converting glTF files to BAM
* Ships with `gltf-viewer` for viewing files (including glTF) with a simple PBR renderer

## Installation

Use pip to install the `panda3d-gltf` package:

```bash
pip install panda3d-gltf
```

To grab the latest development build, use:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Moguri/panda3d-gltf.git

```

## Usage

### Native loading

`panda3d-gltf` ships with a Python file loader (requires Panda3D 1.10.4+), which seamlessly adds glTF support to Panda3D's `Loader` classes.
This *does not* add support to `pview`, which is a C++ application that does not support loading Python file loaders.
Instead of `pview`, use the `gltf-viewer` that ships with `panda3d-gltf`.

### Command Line

To convert glTF files to BAM via the command line, use the supplied `gltf2bam` tool:

```bash
gltf2bam source.gltf output.bam
```

### Viewer

`panda3d-gltf` ships with `gltf-viewer`.
This is a simple viewer (like `pview`) to view glTF (or any other file format support by Panda3D) with a simple, PBR renderer.

## API Stability

Since `panda3d-gltf` has not reached a 1.0 release, its API should not be considered "stable."
However, this mostly applies to internals, and effort will be put into keeping the `gltf2bam` API from breaking.

## Running Tests

First install `panda3d-gltf` in editable mode along with `test` extras:

```bash
pip install -e .[test]
```

Then run the test suite with `pytest`:

```bash
pytest
```

## Building Wheels

Install `build`:

```bash
pip install --upgrade build
```

and run:

```bash
python -m build
```
