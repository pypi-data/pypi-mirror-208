# MarkBassModel

The **MarkBassModel** package is a Python package that provides functions for fitting and predicting using the Bass diffusion model.

## Description

The Bass diffusion model is a popular method in marketing analytics used to forecast the rate of adoption of new products in a market. The MarkBassModel package offers functionality to assist with various tasks related to product marketing and adoption, including:

- Forecasting product sales
- Estimating market potential through diffusion analysis
- Comparing the performance of different products

## Functions

The MarkBassModel package provides the following functions:

### `diffusion(sales)`

This function calculates the cumulative diffusion curve based on the sales data provided.

### `adoption_rate(t, p, q, m, N)`

This function calculates the adoption rate at a given time based on the Bass diffusion model's parameters.

- `t`: Time at which the adoption rate is calculated.
- `p`: Coefficient of innovation.
- `q`: Coefficient of imitation.
- `m`: Total market potential.
- `N`: Cumulative number of adopters at time `t`.

### `bass_f(t, p, q)`

This function calculates the Bass diffusion curve at a given time based on the Bass diffusion model's parameters.

### `bass_F(t, p, q)`

This function calculates the cumulative Bass diffusion curve at a given time based on the Bass diffusion model's parameters.

### `predict_bass_model(params, m)`

This function predicts the diffusion of a new product using the Bass diffusion model's parameters (`p` and `q`) and the total market potential (`m`).

### `plot_bass(p, q, title)`

This function plots the Bass diffusion curve for the given parameters `p` and `q`. The `title` parameter specifies the title of the plot.

## Installation

You can install the MarkBassModel package using pip:

```shell
pip install markbassmodel
```

## Usage

To use the MarkBassModel package, start by importing it:

```python
import markbassmodel
```

To calculate the parameters:

```python
markbassmodel.diffusion(sales)
```

To plot the Bass diffusion curve:

```python
markbassmodel.plot_bass(params['p'], params['q'], 'Bass diffusion curve')
```

## Example Data

You can find a sample dataset of smartphone sales over a period of time [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rtiKrg9xa2TMH8cTqN2l-eHWqQG1ZH6c?usp=sharing). You can use this dataset to test and experiment with the MarkBassModel package.
