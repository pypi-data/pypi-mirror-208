Non fungible tokens (NFTs)
===========================
Non fungible tokens, a.k.a NFT are unique digital assets which live on a 
blockchain, without the ability to be replicated.
Most commonly they represent digital art work.

    Example of a NFT (generated by `DALL-E <https://openai.com/dall-e-2/>`_)


NFT differ from things like Etherium in the way that they are non-fungible.
Non fungible means that a single NFT asset cannot be simply exchanged for another
NFT asset, like you can exchange a barrel of oil for another barrel of oil or a dollar for another dollar.

The closest example to a NFT in a physical form would be a baseball card. For example, you could have a very rare 
baseball card of some baseball player and you could not exchange it equivalently for some other common baseball card.

NFTs are created thru minting, which is a process in which, the information
of the NFT is put on the blockchain. A new block is created on the blockchain, and often a smart contract is used
that sets transferability and assigns an owner to the NFT.
While the NFT is being minted, it is also given a unique identifier directly connected to one
blockchain address. The tokens all have a owner and this ownership information is public to everyone.

NFTs are quickly gaining popularity as a way to hold cryptocurrency and as a potential financial investment.
They can also be used as collateral for loans or to represent financial products that can be traded on secondary markets.
The popularity of NFTs reflects the growing interest in digital assets in a digital world, including the development of the "metaverse," a network of interactive virtual worlds.
NFTs will also likely play a significant role in the evolution of advertising and marketing, as brands may begin to trial products in digital form before deciding to manufacture them in physical form.
Additionally, the contract and blockchain technology underlying NFTs have commercial potential, such as allowing the creator of an NFT to receive a royalty fee every time the NFT is sold.
In the coming years, businesses are expected to make increasing use of NFTs for advertising, fee generation, and other aspects of their business models.


Shilling
===================
While you may of heard of NFTs before, you might not of heard of the process called *shilling*.
Shilling is term for promotion / advertising NFTs on social media.
But it isn't just any kind of advertising, like putting some promotional material on a website or having
a stand on the public for promotion, but instead is a more controversial method of marketing that is 
more engaged. 
Shilling includes constantly posting about the product on social media like Instagram, Telegram, Discord, itd.,
mentioning it and sharing links to the product everywhere possible.

It is viewed more as a spam method of marketing.

These days NFT owners usually don't shill themselves but instead hire people to do the shilling for them.
Since this can be done completely remotely on electronic devices, there is a vast amount of jobs for it
that can be quite profitable, especially if you have a software that allows you to automatically shill without you
even being present.

The thesis' project doesn't focus on NFTs themselves much, but instead focuses on the shilling process, more specifically to
the social network called **Discord**.

The thesis talks about the project named **Discord Advertisement Framework**, which is a `Python <https://www.python.org>`_ based
automatic Discord shiller.
