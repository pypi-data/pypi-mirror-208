        `wgd v2` is a python package upgraded from the original `wgd` package aiming for the inference and timing of ancient whole-genome duplication (WGD) events. For the propose of illustrating the principle and usage of `wgd v2`, we compiled this documentation. Below we first give an introduction over the scope and mechanism of `wgd v2` and then the practical information of installation and usage. An examplar workflow is provided in the tutorial section on how to seek evidence for a putative WGD event and perform proper timing with a freshly obtained genome assembly in hand. For those who are interested, we recommend turning to our paper and book chapter for more detailed description and insightful discussions. If you use `wgd v2` in your research, please cite us. 
        
        ## Introduction
        
        Polyploidizations, the evolutionary process that the entire genome of an organism is duplicated, also named as whole-genome duplications (WGDs), occur recurrently across the tree of life. There are two modes of polyploidizations, autopolyploidizations and allopolyploidizations. Autopolyploidizations are the duplication of the same genome, resulting in two identical subgenomes at the time it emerged. While the allopolyploidizations are normally achieved in two steps, first the hybridization between two different species, resulting in the arising of transient homoploidy,second the duplication of the homoploidy, resulting in the emergence of allopolyploidy. Due to the unstability and unbalanced tetrasomic inheritance, for instance the nuclear-cytoplasmic incompatibility, the polyploidy genome will then experience a process called diploidization, also named as fractionation, during which a large portion of gene duplicates will get lost and only a fraction can be retained. The traces of polyploidizations can be thus unearthed from these retained gene duplicates. Three approaches based on gene duplicates, namely, *K*<sub>S</sub> method, gene tree - species tree reconciliation method and synteny method, are commonly used in detecting evidence for WGDs. The gene tree - species tree reconciliation method is not within the scope of `wgd v2`, but we kindly refer readers who are interested to the phylogenomic program developed by Arthur Zwaenepoel named [WHALE](https://github.com/arzwa/Whale.jl) and the associated [paper](https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msz088) for more technical and theoretical details.
        
        The *K*<sub>S</sub> method is established on a model of gene family evolution that each gene family is allowed to evolve via gene duplication and loss. Note that the gene family here is assumed to be the cluster of all genes descended from an ancestral gene in a single genome. Recovering the gene tree of such gene family informs the timing, scilicet the age, of gene duplication events. The age refered here, is not in real geological time, but in the unit of evolutionary distance, i.e., the number of substitutions per site. When the evolutionary rate remains approximately constant, the evolutionary distance is then supposed to be proportional to the real evolutionary time. The synonymous distance *K*<sub>S</sub>, the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site, is such candidate that synonymous substitutions would not incur the change of amino acid and are thus regarded as neutral, which according to the neutral theory should occur in constant rate. Given a model of gene family that allows the gene to duplicate and get lost in a fixed rate, one can derive that the probability density function of the *K*<sub>S</sub> age distribution of retained gene duplicates is a quasi-exponential function that most retained gene duplicates are recently borned with ~0 age while as the age going older the associated number of retained gene duplicates decay quasi-exponentially. Therefore, the occurance of large-scale gene duplication events, for instane WGDs, with varied retention rate, will leave an age peak from the burst of gene duplicates in a short time-frame upon the initial age distribution, and can be unveiled from mixture modeling analysis. However, WGDs identified from the paralogous *K*<sub>S</sub> age distributions can only inform the WGD timing in the time-scale of that specific species, which is not comparable in the phylogenetic context. Only with the orthologous *K*<sub>S</sub> age distributions, which convert the estimated body from paralogues to orthologues and inform the relative timing of speciation events, can we decipher the phylogenetic placement of WGDs after proper rate correction. `wgd v2` is such program that helps users construct paralogous and orthologous *K*<sub>S</sub> age distributions and realize both the identification and placement of WGDs.

        ## Illustration
        
        We illustrate our program on an exemplary WGD inference and dating upon species *Aquilegia coerulea*.
        
        The *Aquilegia coerulea* was reported to experience an paleo-polyploidization event after the divergence of core eudicots, which is likely shared by all Ranunculales.
        
        First above all, let's delineate the whole paranome *K*<sub>S</sub> age distribution and have a basic observation for potentially conceivable WGDs, using the command line below.
        
        ```
        wgd dmd Aquilegia_coerulea
        wgd ksd wgd_dmd/Aquilegia_coerulea.tsv Aquilegia_coerulea
        ```
        
        The constructed whole paranome *K*<sub>S</sub> age distribution of *Aquilegia coerulea* is as below, we can see that there seems to be a hump at *K*<sub>S</sub> 1 but not clear.
        
        ![](data/Aquilegia_coerulea.tsv.ksd_wp.svg)
        
        We then construct the anchor *K*<sub>S</sub> age distribution using the command line below.
        
        ```
        wgd syn -f mRNA -a Name wgd_dmd/Aquilegia_coerulea.tsv Aquilegia_coerulea.gff3 -ks wgd_ksd/Aquilegia_coerulea.tsv.ks.tsv
        ```
        
        As shown below, there are some retained anchor pairs with *K*<sub>S</sub> between 1 and 2, which seems to suggest a WGD event.
        
        ![](data/Aquilegia_coerulea.tsv.ksd_wp_ap.svg)
        
        The associated `dupStack` plot shows that there are numerous duplicated segments across most of the chromosomes, except for the chr_07, which seems to experience more severe fragmentization than the other chromosomes.
        
        ![](data/Aquilegia_coerulea_Aquilegia_coerulea_multiplicons_level.svg)
        
        The associated dotplot in oxford grid also presents numerous densely aggregated anchor points throughout most of the chromosomes.
        
        ![](data/Aquilegia_coerulea-vs-Aquilegia_coerulea.dot.png)
        
        A further associated Syndepth plot shows that there are more than 80 duplicated segments, which dominates the whole collinear ratio category.
        
        ![](data/Syndepth.svg)
        
        We can fit an ELMM mixture model upon the whole paranome *K*<sub>S</sub> age distribution to see more accurately the significance and location of potential WGDs, using the command line below.
        
        ```
        wgd viz -d wgd_ksd/Aquilegia_coerulea.tsv.ks.tsv
        ```
        
        The result of ELMM mixture model clustering shows that there is a likely WGD component at *K*<sub>S</sub> 1.19.
        
        ![](data/elmm_Aquilegia_coerulea.tsv.ks.tsv_best_models_weighted.svg)
        
        Let's do a mixture model clustering for anchor *K*<sub>S</sub> too, using the command line below.
        
        ```
        wgd peak wgd_ksd/Aquilegia_coerulea.tsv.ks.tsv --anchorpoints wgd_syn/iadhore-out/anchorpoints.txt --segments wgd_syn/iadhore-out/segments.txt --listelements wgd_syn/iadhore-out/list_elements.txt --multipliconpairs wgd_syn/iadhore-out/multiplicon_pairs.txt --weighted
        ```
        
        The anchor *K*<sub>S</sub> age distribution also has a likely WGD component with mode 1.28.
        
        ![](data/Original_AnchorKs_GMM_Component3_node_weighted_Lognormal.svg)
        
        Now that we have seen the evidence of numerous duplicated segments and the aggregation of duplicates age in *K*<sub>S</sub> around 1.2 for anchor pairs and non-anchor pairs throughout the whole genome. We can claim with some confidence that *Aquilegia coerulea* might have experienced a paleo-polyploidization event. Next, Let's have a further look about its phylogenetic location. We know that there are uncertainties about whether this putative paleo-polyploidization event is shared with all eudicots or not. We can choose some other eudicot genomes to see the ordering of speciation and polyploidization events. Here we choose *Vitis vinifera*, *Protea cynaroides* and *Acorus americanus* in the following *K*<sub>S</sub> analysis.
