Large, low Earth orbit, broadband satellite networks, have recently become a growing area of research as a number of implementations are currently being constructed by commercial businesses. Unlike current systems, these new constellations are comprised of 100s to 1,000s of interconnected satellites. This Thesis seeks to create and demonstrate a tool for generating and simulating such networks.
