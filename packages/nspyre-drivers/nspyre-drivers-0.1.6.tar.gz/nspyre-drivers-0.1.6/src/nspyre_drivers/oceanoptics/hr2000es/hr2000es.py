Use spec.features to see cseabreeze features
Information on this is in python-seabreeze.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backend_api.html
Access trigger mode using
spec.features['spectrometer'][0].set_trigger_mode(5)

Based on page 18 of this reference

It looks like we want to use data value 4 which will turn on external hardware edge trigger mode.
* Note from page 14 that it looks like it takes 900us to put data into FIFO and 1ms to read data from FIFO.

"In the External Hardware Edge Trigger mode, a rising edge detected by the FPGA from the External
Trigger input starts the Integration Cycle specified through the software interface. After the Integration
Cycle completes, the spectrum is retrieved and written to the FIFO in the FPGA followed by a CCD Reset
Cycle. Only one acquisition will be performed for each External Trigger pulse, no matter what the
pulseâ€™s duration is. The Reset Cycle insures that the CCD performance uniform on a scan-to-scan basis.
The time duration for this reset cycle is relative to the Integration Cycle time and will change if the
integration period is changed. So the timing sequence is Trigger, Trigger Delay, Integration Cycle,
Read/Write Cycle, Reset Cycle, and Idle Cycle(s). The Idle Cycle will until the next trigger occurs."

From page 19 of https://www.oceaninsight.com/globalassets/catalog-blocks-and-images/manuals--instruction-old-logo/spectrometer/hr2000-.pdf
Looks like on the 30-pin cable we need to trigger on 10 and ground on 5.
On the 15-pin cable we need to trigger on 4,5, or 8 and connect to ground on 10.

Maybe can also set the trigger mode this way?
