# üß©üí° PromptFlow

Want to quickly prototype your Large Language Model (LLM) application without a ton of code? Unleash your creativity with **PromptFlow**, a low-code tool that empowers you to craft executable flowcharts. Seamlessly integrate LLMs, prompts, Python functions, and conditional logic to create intricate workflows. With PromptFlow, you can visualize your ideas and bring them to life, all without getting tangled in code or complex logic.

## üîó How it works

The core of PromptFlow is a visual flowchart editor that lets you design nodes and establish Connections between them. Each node can represent a Prompt, a Python function, or an LLM. The connections between nodes embody conditional logic, dictating the flow of your program.

When run your flowchart, PromptFlow executes each node in the sequence defined by the connections, transferring text data between nodes as required. If a node returns a value, that value is forwarded to the next node in the flow as a string. More information on the inner workings of PromptFlow can be found in our [documentation](https://www.promptflow.org/en/latest/).

## üõ†Ô∏è Initial Setup 

Kickstart your PromptFlow journey by installing the required dependencies. Python 3.8+ is required to run PromptFlow.

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Encountered a hiccup? Try this instead:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements-no-nvidia.txt
```

## üöÄ Launching

Fire up PromptFlow with Python from the command line:

```bash
python run.py 
```

If you're hitting a roadblock, ensure your `PYTHONPATH` is set correctly:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:.
```
