A collection of basic modules needed for almost every flask application.

    pip install base_flask_structure

    from bfs.config import Settings
    from bfs.database import AbstractDataBase

    settings = Settings()  # Calls singleton class Settings

    class DataBase(AbstractDataBase):
        def init_db(self):
            """
            Implements init_db method to initialize 
            the database and create all the tables.
            """
