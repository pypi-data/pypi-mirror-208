# Quant Invest Lab
**Quant Invest Lab** is a project aimed to provide a set of basic tools for quantitative experiments. By quantitative experiment I mean trying to build you own set of investments solution. The project is still in its early stage, but I hope it will grow in the future.

Initially this project was aimed to be a set of tools for my own experiments, but I decided to make it open source. Of courses it already exists some awesome packages, more detailed, better suited for some use cases. But I hope it will be useful for someone else. Feel free to use it, modify it and contribute to it.*
