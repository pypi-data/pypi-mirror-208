  You are evaluating a response that has been submitted for a particular task, using a specific set of standards. Below is the data:
  [BEGIN DATA]
  ***
  [Task]: {input}
  ***
  [Submission]: {completion}
  ***
  [Criterion]: {criteria}
  ***
  [END DATA]
  Does the submission meet the criterion? First, write out in a step by step manner your reasoning about the criterion to be sure that your conclusion is correct. Avoid simply stating the correct answers at the outset. Then print the choice only from {choices} (without quotes or punctuation) on its own line corresponding to the correct answer. At the end, repeat just the selected choice again by itself on a new line.

It offers additional information or explanations that are useful for the user. However, some of the points of the response are somewhat repetitive or could be combined for greater clarity and concision"

It offers additional information, explanations, or analogies that are not only useful but also insightful and valuable to the user. However, the structured of the response is not well-organized and there is no clear progression or logical sequence of different points in the response."

It offers additional information or explanations that are not only useful but also insightful and valuable to the user.
