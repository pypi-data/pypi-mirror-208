# PUFFY

A collection of modules with zero-dependencies to help manage common programming tasks.

```
pip install puffy
```

Usage examples:

```python
from puffy.error import catch_errors

# This function will never fail. Instead, the error is safely caught.
@catch_errors
def fail():
    raise Exception("Failed")
    return "yes"

err, resp = fail() # `err` and `resp` are respectively None and Object when the function is successull. Otherwise, they are respectively StackedException and None.
```

```python
from puffy.object import JSON as js

obj = js({ 'hello':'world' })
obj['person']['name'] = 'Nic' # Notice it does not fail.
obj.s('address.line1', 'Magic street') # Sets obj.address.line1 to 'Magic street' and return 'Magic street'
```

# APIs
## `error`

The `error` module exposes the following APIs:
- `catch_errors`: A higher-order function that returns a function that always return a tuple `(error, response)`. If the `error` is `None`, then the function did not fail. Otherwise, it did and the `error` object can be used to build an error stack.
- `StackedException`: A class that inherits from `Exception`. Use it to stack errors.

### Basic `error` APIs - Getting in control of your errors

```python
from puffy.error import catch_errors

# This function will never fail. Instead, the error is safely caught.
@catch_errors
def fail():
    raise Exception("Failed")
    return "yes"

err, resp = fail() 

print(resp) # None
print(type(err)) # <class 'src.puffy.error.StackedException'> which inherits from Exception
print(str(err)) # Failed
print(len(err.stack)) # 1
print(str(err.stack[0])) # Failed
print(err.stack[0].__traceback__) # <traceback object at 0x7fc69066bf00>

# Use the `strinfigy` method to extract the full error stack details.
print(err.strinfigy()) 
# error: Failed
#   File "blablabla.py", line 72, in safe_exec
#     data = ffn(*args, **named_args)
#   File "blablabla.py", line 28, in fail
#     raise Exception("Failed")
```

### Nested errors and error stack

```python
from puffy.error import catch_errors, StackedException

# This function will never fail. Instead, the error is safely caught.
@catch_errors("Should fail")
def fail():
    err, resp = fail_again()
    if err:
        raise StackedException("As expected, it failed!", err) 
        # StackedException accepts an arbitrary number of inputs of type str or Exception:
        # 	- raise StackedException(err) 
        # 	- raise StackedException('This', 'is', 'a new error') 
    return "yes"

@catch_errors("Should fail again")
def fail_again():
    raise Exception("Failed again")
    return "yes"

err, resp = fail()

print(len(err.stack)) # 4
print(str(err.stack[0])) # Should fail
print(str(err.stack[1])) # As expected, it failed!
print(str(err.stack[2])) # Should fail again
print(str(err.stack[3])) # Failed again

# Use the `strinfigy` method to extract the full error stack details.
print(err.strinfigy()) 
# error: Should fail
#   File "blablabla.py", line 72, in fail
# error: As expected, it failed!
#   File "blablabla.py", line 72, in fail
# error: Should fail again
#   File "blablabla.py", line 72, in fail
# error: Failed again
#   File "blablabla.py", line 72, in safe_exec
#     data = ffn(*args, **named_args)
#   File "blablabla.py", line 28, in fail_again
#     raise Exception("Failed")
```

### Managing errors in `async/await` corountines

```python
from puffy.error import async_catch_errors
import asyncio

# This function will never fail. Instead, the error is safely caught.
@async_catch_errors
async def fail():
    await asyncio.sleep(0.01)
    raise Exception("Failed")
    return "yes"

loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
err, resp = loop.run_until_complete(fail())

print(resp) # None
print(type(err)) # <class 'src.puffy.error.StackedException'> which inherits from Exception
print(str(err)) # Failed
print(len(err.stack)) # 1
print(str(err.stack[0])) # Failed
print(err.stack[0].__traceback__) # <traceback object at 0x7fc69066bf00>

# Use the `strinfigy` method to extract the full error stack details.
print(err.strinfigy()) 
# error: Failed
#   File "blablabla.py", line 72, in safe_exec
#     data = ffn(*args, **named_args)
#   File "blablabla.py", line 28, in fail
#     raise Exception("Failed")
```

## `log`
### Basic `log` APIs

This method prints a structured log to stdout. That structured log is a standard Python `dict` which is then serialized to `str` using `json.dumps`. This method is designed to never fail. It was originally designed to log messages to AWS CloudWatch.

```python
from puffy.log import log

log() # '{ "level":"INFO" }'

log(
    level="WARN", # Supported values: "INFO" (default), "WARN" (or "WARNING"), "ERROR", "CRITICAL"
    message="Seems drunk",
    code="drunky_drunky",
    metric=23,
    unit="beers", # Default is "ms" (i.e., milliseconds)
    data= {
        "name": "Dave",
        "age": 45
    },
    op_id= 12345,
    test=True
) # '{"level": "WARN", "message": "Seems drunk", "code": "drunky_drunky", "test": true, "metric": 23, "unit": "beers", "op_id": 12345, "data": {"name": "Dave", "age": 45}}'

# Logging time:
log(
    level="WARN", # Supported values: "INFO" (default), "WARN" (or "WARNING"), "ERROR", "CRITICAL"
    message="Seems drunk",
    code="drunky_drunky",
    time=34 # This is converted to the "metric" input with "unit" set to "ms" (cannot be overwritten)
) # '{"level": "WARN", "message": "Seems drunk", "code": "drunky_drunky", "metric": 34, "unit": "ms"}'
```

### Logging errors

The `log` API is designed to support puffy's `StackedException` errors. The advantage of using `StackedException` is that you can have confidence that the stacked errors are properly serialized (i.e., including message and traceback).

```python
from puffy.log import log
from puffy.error import catch_errors, StackedException as e

@catch_errors("Should fail")
def fail():
    err, resp = fail_again()
    if err:
        raise e(err)
    return "yes"

@catch_errors("Should fail again")
def fail_again():
    raise Exception("Failed again")
    return "yes"

err, *_ = fail()

# Supports `StackedException`
log(
    level="ERROR",
    errors=err) 
# '{"level": "INFO", "errors": "error: Should fail\n  File \"/Users/.../ur_code.py\", line 153, in fail\nerror: Should fail again\n  File \"/Users/.../ur_code.py\", line 153, in fail\nerror: Failed again\n  File \"/Users/.../ur_code.py\", line 112, in safe_exec\n    data = ffn(*args, **named_args)\n  File \"/Users/.../ur_code.py\", line 162, in fail_again\n    raise Exception(\"Failed again\")\n"}'

# Supports standard errors
log(
    level="ERROR",
    errors=Exception("Bim bam boom")) # '{"level": "ERROR", "errors": "Bim bam boom"}'

# Supports strings
log(
    level="ERROR",
    errors="Bim bam boom") # '{"level": "ERROR", "errors": "Bim bam boom"}'

# Supports list of errors
log(
    level="ERROR",
    errors=["Bim bam boom", Exception("Booom"), err]) # '{"level": "ERROR", "errors": "Bim bam boom\nBooom\nerror: Should fail\n  File \"/Users/.../ur_code.py\", line 153, in fail\nerror: Should fail again\n  File \"/Users/.../ur_code.py\", line 153, in fail\nerror: Failed again\n  File \"/Users/.../ur_code.py\", line 112, in safe_exec\n    data = ffn(*args, **named_args)\n  File \"/Users/.../ur_code.py\", line 162, in fail_again\n    raise Exception(\"Failed again\")\n"}'
```

### Environment variables

Often, specific common metadata must be added to all logs (e.g., server's details, api name, ...). For this purpose, use the `LOG_META` environment variable. This environment variable expects a stringified JSON object:

```python
from puffy.log import log

os.environ["LOG_META"] = json.dumps({"api_name": "hello"})

log(level="INFO", message="hello world") # '{"api_name": "hello", "level": "INFO", "message": "hello world"}'
```

## `object`
### `JSON` API

```python
from puffy.object import JSON as js

obj = js({ 'hello':'world' })
obj['person']['name'] = 'Nic' # Notice it does not fail.
obj.s('address.line1', 'Magic street') # Sets obj.address.line1 to 'Magic street' and return 'Magic street'

print(obj['person']['name']) # Nic
print(obj) # { 'hello':'world', 'person': { 'name': 'Nic' } }
print(obj.g('address.line1')) # Magic street
print(obj) # { 'hello':'world', 'person': { 'name': None }, 'address': { 'line1': 'Magic street' } }
print(obj.g('address.line2')) # Nonce
print(obj) # { 'hello':'world', 'person': { 'name': None }, 'address': { 'line1': 'Magic street', line2: None } }
```

```
2. Browse to the root folder:
```shell
cd pypuffy
```
3. Create a new virtual environment:
```shell
python3 -m venv .venv
```
4. Activate this virtual environment:
```shell
source .venv/bin/activate
```

To deactivate that virtual environment:
```shell
deactivate
```

## CLI commands

`make` commands:

| Command | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| `python3 -m venv .venv` | Create a new virtual environment. |

| `easyv bump x.x.x` | Sets the version defined in `setup.cfg` to x.x.x (1).|

> __(1):__ Bumping a version using `easyv` can apply up to three updates:
>1. Updates the version property in the `setup.cfg` file.
>2. If the project is under source control with git and git is installed:
>   1. Updates the `CHANGELOG.md` file using the commit messages between the current branch and the last version tag. If the `CHANGELOG.md` file does not exist, it is automatically created.
>   2. git commit and tag (using the version number prefixed with `v`) the project.

## Install dependencies with `easypipinstall`

`easypipinstall` adds three new CLI utilities: `easyi` (install) `easyu` (uninstall) and `easyv` (manages package's version). To learn the full details about `easypipinstall`, please refer to https://github.com/nicolasdao/easypipinstall.

Examples:
```
easyi numpy
```

This installs `numpy` (via `pip install`) then automatically updates the following files:
- `setup.cfg` (WARNING: this file must already exists):
	```
	[options]
	install_requires = 
		numpy
	```
- `requirements.txt` and `prod-requirements.txt`

```
easyi flake8 black -D
```

This installs `flake8` and `black` (via `pip install`) then automatically updates the following files:
- `setup.cfg` (WARNING: this file must already exists):
	```
	[options.extras_require]
	dev = 
		black
		flake8
	```
- `requirements.txt` only, as those dependencies are installed for development purposes only.

```
easyu flake8
```

This uninstalls `flake8` as well as all its dependencies. Those dependencies are uninstalled only if they are not used by other project dependencies. The `setup.cfg` and `requirements.txt` are automatically updated accordingly.

## Linting, formatting and testing

```
make t
```

This command runs the following three python executables:

```
black ./
flake8 ./
pytest --capture=no --verbose $(testpath)
```

- `black` formats all the `.py` files, while `flake8` lints them. 
- `black` is configured in the `pyproject.toml` file under the `[tool.black]` section.
- `flake8` is configured in the `setup.cfg` file under the `[flake8]` section.
- `pytest` runs all the `.py` files located under the `tests` folder. The meaning of each option is as follow:
	- `--capture=no` allows the `print` function to send outputs to the terminal. 
	- `--verbose` displays each test. Without it, the terminal would only display the count of how many passed and failed.
	- `$(testpath)` references the `testpath` variable. This variable is set to `tests` (i.e., the `tests` folder) by default. This allows to override this default variable with something else (e.g., a specific test to only run that one).

### Ignoring `flake8` errors

This project is pre-configured to ignore certain `flake8` errors. To add or remove `flake8` errors, update the `extend-ignore` property under the `[flake8]` section in the `setup.cfg` file.

### Skipping tests

In your test file, add the `@pytest.mark.skip()` decorator. For example:

```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.skip()
def test_self_describing_another_test_name():
	# ... your test here
```

### Executing a specific test only

One of the output of the `make t` command is list of all the test that were run (PASSED and FAILED). For example:

```
tests/error/test_catch_errors.py::test_catch_errors_basic PASSED
tests/error/test_catch_errors.py::test_catch_errors_wrapped PASSED
tests/error/test_catch_errors.py::test_catch_errors_nested_errors PASSED
tests/error/test_catch_errors.py::test_catch_errors_StackedException_arbitrary_inputs FAILED
```

To execute a specific test only, add the `testpath` option with the test path. For example, to execute the only FAILED test in the example above, run this command:

```
make t testpath=tests/error/test_catch_errors.py::test_catch_errors_StackedException_arbitrary_inputs
```

## Building and distributing this package

1. Make sure the test and lint operations have not produced errors:
```shell
make t
```
2. Version and tag this package using one of the following commands (1):
    - `easyv bump`: Use this to bump the patch version.
    - `easyv bump minor`: Use this to bump the minor version.
    - `easyv bump major`: Use this to bump the major version.
    - `easyv bump x.x.x`: Use this to bump the version to a specific value.
3. Push those latest changes to your source control repository (incl. tags). For example:
```shell
git push origin master --follow-tags
```
4. Build this package:
```shell
make b
```
> This command is a wrapper around `python3 -m build`.
5. Publish this package to https://pypi.org:
```shell
make p
```
> This command is a wrapper around the following commands: `python3 -m build; twine upload dist/*`


To test your package locally before deploying it to https://pypi.org, you can run build and install it locally with this command:

```shell
make bi
```

This command buils the package and follows with `pip install -e .`.

> (1): This step applies three updates:
> 1. Updates the version property in the `setup.cfg` file.
> 2. Updates the `CHANGELOG.md` file using the commit messages between the current branch and the last version tag.
> 3. git commit and tag (using the version number prefixed with `v`) the project.
