        Installation
        ------------
        
        This package can be installed using the following command:
        
        ```sh

        ```
        
        Example Usage
        -------------
        
        Here are some usage examples as Python REPL sessions. This should work in the REPL, notebooks, or in traditional scripts and applications.
        
        ### Text Completions
        
        ```python
        >>> import languagemodels as lm
        
        >>> lm.complete("She hid in her room until")
        'she was sure she was safe'
        ```
        
        ### Instruction Following
        
        ```python
        >>> import languagemodels as lm
        
        >>> lm.do("Translate to English: Hola, mundo!")
        'Hello, world!'
        
        >>> lm.do("What is the capital of France?")
        'paris'
        ```
        
        ### Classification
        
        ```python
        >>> import languagemodels as lm
        
        >>> lm.classify("Language models are useful", "positive", "negative")
        'positive'
        ```
        
        ### Semantic Search
        
        ```python
        >>> import languagemodels as lm
        
        >>> lm.store_doc("Mars is a planet")
        >>> lm.store_doc("The sun is hot")
        >>> lm.search_docs("What is Mars?")
        'Mars is a planet'
        ```
        
        ### Extractive Question Answering
        
        ```python
        >>> import languagemodels as lm
        
        >>> lm.extract_answer("What color is the ball?", "There is a green ball and a red box")
        'green'
        ```
        
        ### External Retrieval
        
        ```python
        >>> import languagemodels as lm
        
        >>> lm.fetch_wiki('Chemistry')
        'Chemistry is the scientific study...
        
        >>> lm.fetch_weather(41.8, -87.6)
        'Partly cloudy with a chance of rain...
        ```
        
        ### Misc Text Tools
        
        ```python
        >>> import languagemodels as lm
        
        >>> get_date()
        'Friday, May 12, 2023 at 09:27AM'
        ```
