Description: # [WIP] dreye
        
        ## DrEye: Exploiting Color Space Geometry for Visual Stimulus Design across Animals
        
        Dreye is still being actively developed and tested, and documentation will be added soon. Currently, we are redesigning some of the API in order to make it easier to use and speed up some of our algorithms. Our redesign will be finished by mid-November, but our old API will remain for backwards compatibility
        
        The current documentation focuses on the old API, but will be updated in the next weeks.
        
        ## Timeline for new API release
        
        Nov 8: API ready for testing
        Nov 15: Tutorials for new API
        Nov 31: Web application for stimulus design and color space manipulation
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```
        pip install dreye
        ```
        
        ## Hardware module
        
        For the hardware module in dreye the following packages will also have to be installed:
        
        ```
        pip install seabreeze>=1.0.1
        pip install nidaqmx>=0.5.7
        ```
        
        ## Development
        
        Currently, we are redesigning the API for ease-of-use. If you are interested in helping us redesign and contribute to our project, please email at gucky@gucky.eu.
        We would also love any type of general feedback or contributions to the code and methods implemented.
