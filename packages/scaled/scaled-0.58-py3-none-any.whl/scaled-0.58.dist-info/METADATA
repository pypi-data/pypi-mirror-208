# Scaled
This project is aiming the target that provides very light, efficient, reliable way for distribute computing 
framework, like dask and ray, it uses centralized scheduler (like dask, unlike ray) and language agnostic protocol 
between client and scheduler, or between scheduler and worker.

# Introduction
The goal for this project should be as simple as possible
- It built on top of zmq
- it has ready python version of Client, Scheduler, Worker
- I will provide golang or Rust version of Scheduler, the goal for the Scheduler should be completely computer language 
  agnostic, which means they follow the same protocol
- Scheduler might support function based computing tree in the future

# Installation
`pip install scaled`

if you want to use uvloop, please do: `pip install uvloop`, default we are using python builtin uvloop


# How to use it
The use experience is very close to dask

## Start local scheduler and cluster at the same time in the code

```python
import random

from scaled.client import Client
from scaled.cluster.combo import SchedulerClusterCombo


def calculate(sec: int):
    return sec * 1


def main():
    address = "tcp://127.0.0.1:2345"

    cluster = SchedulerClusterCombo(address=address, n_workers=10, event_loop="uvloop")
    client = Client(address=address)

    tasks = [random.randint(0, 100) for _ in range(100000)]
    futures = [client.submit(calculate, i) for i in tasks]

    results = [future.result() for future in futures]

    assert results == tasks

    client.disconnect()
    cluster.shutdown()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Start scheduler and cluster independently

use `scaled_scheduler` to start scheduler, for example:
```bash
$ scaled_scheduler tcp://0.0.0.0:8516
[INFO]2023-03-19 12:16:10-0400: logging to ('/dev/stdout',)
[INFO]2023-03-19 12:16:10-0400: use event loop: 2
[INFO]2023-03-19 12:16:10-0400: Scheduler: monitor address is ipc:///tmp/0.0.0.0_8516_monitor
[INFO]2023-03-19 12:16:10-0400: AsyncBinder: started
[INFO]2023-03-19 12:16:10-0400: VanillaTaskManager: started
[INFO]2023-03-19 12:16:10-0400: VanillaFunctionManager: started
[INFO]2023-03-19 12:16:10-0400: VanillaWorkerManager: started
[INFO]2023-03-19 12:16:10-0400: StatusReporter: started
```

use `scaled_cluster` to start 10 workers:
```bash
$ scaled_worker -n 10 tcp://127.0.0.1:8516
[INFO]2023-03-19 12:19:19-0400: logging to ('/dev/stdout',)
[INFO]2023-03-19 12:19:19-0400: ClusterProcess: starting 23 workers, heartbeat_interval_seconds=2, function_retention_seconds=3600
[INFO]2023-03-19 12:19:19-0400: Worker[0] started
[INFO]2023-03-19 12:19:19-0400: Worker[1] started
[INFO]2023-03-19 12:19:19-0400: Worker[2] started
[INFO]2023-03-19 12:19:19-0400: Worker[3] started
[INFO]2023-03-19 12:19:19-0400: Worker[4] started
[INFO]2023-03-19 12:19:19-0400: Worker[5] started
[INFO]2023-03-19 12:19:19-0400: Worker[6] started
[INFO]2023-03-19 12:19:19-0400: Worker[7] started
[INFO]2023-03-19 12:19:19-0400: Worker[8] started
[INFO]2023-03-19 12:19:19-0400: Worker[9] started
```

for detail options of above 2 program, please use argument `-h` to check out all available options

Then you can write simply write client code as:

```python
from scaled.client import Client


def foobar(foo: int):
    return foo


client = Client(address="tcp://127.0.0.1:2345")
future = client.submit(foobar, 1)

print(future.result())
```

## Scheduler

As scaled_scheduler only need communicate with client and worker with protocol, so scaled_scheduler can be packaged and
distributed independently, unless protocol changes. It can be used for scheduling tasks that by other language 
implementations of client/worker too.

Assume there is implementation of scaled protocol written in C++, has client and worker side, it can use python version
of scaled_scheduler for task scheduling and balancing

### Scheduler Benchmark

Initially I was thinking to implement C++ or Rust version of scheduler that follows the protocol, but seems PyPy works
pretty well, the scheduling overhead will be reduced by ~60%. Below is a simple benchmark chart, I used 100k noop tasks
to just test how much overhead does scheduler will introduce

**Note: as dask took 110 seconds to finish same amount of 100k noop tasks, I will not list it to below chart**

| Python  | Version   | Event Loop | Time    |
|---------|-----------|------------|---------|
| CPython | 3.10      | asyncio    | 19.131s |
| CPython | 3.10      | uvloop     | 17.809s |
| CPython | 3.11.3    | asyncio    | 19.475s |
| CPython | 3.11.3    | uvloop     | 18.406s |
| PyPy    | 3.9.16    | asyncio    | 8.748s  |
| PyPy    | 3.9.16    | uvloop     | N/A     |

* Test machine is AMD 5900X with 32gb RAM, started 10 workers


### Package scheduler as one file

Here is how to use nuitka to compile package into one file (doesn't provide speedup):

```shell
nuitka3 --standalone --onefile --no-pyi-file --remove-output --include-package=uvloop --output-filename=scaled_scheduler ./run_scheduler.py
nuitka3 --standalone --onefile --no-pyi-file --remove-output --output-filename=scaled_top ./run_top.py
```

Here is how to use pex to package into one file:
```shell
pex scaled -c scaled_scheduler -o scaled_scheduler
pex scaled -c scaled_top -o scaled_top
```


## Graph Task

Scaled also supports submit graph task, for example:

```python
from scaled.client import Client


def inc(i):
    return i + 1

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def minus(a, b):
    return a - b

graph = {
    "a": 2,
    "b": 2, 
    "c": (inc, "a"),  # c = a + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3
    "d": (add, "a", "b"),  # d = a + b = 2 + 2 = 4
    "e": (minus, "d", "c")  # e = d - c = 4 - 3 = 1
}

client = Client(address="tcp://127.0.0.1:2345")
futures = client.submit_graph(graph, keys=["e"])

print(futures[0].result())
```

# Scaled Top
You can use `scaled_top` to connect to scheduler monitor address to get some insides of the scaled_top
```bash
$ scaled_top ipc:///tmp/0.0.0.0_8516_monitor
```

Which will something similar to top command, but it's for getting status of the scaled system:
```bash
scheduler          | task_manager         |   scheduler_sent         | scheduler_received
      cpu     0.0% |   unassigned       0 | FunctionResponse      24 |          Heartbeat 183,109
      rss 37.1 MiB |      running       0 |         TaskEcho 200,000 |    FunctionRequest      24
                   |      success 200,000 |             Task 200,000 |               Task 200,000
                   |       failed       0 |       TaskResult 200,000 |         TaskResult 200,000
                   |     canceled       0 |   BalanceRequest       4 |    BalanceResponse       4

```

- scheduler section is showing how much resources scheduler used
- task_manager section shows count for each task status
- scheduler_sent section shows count for each type of messages scheduler sent
- scheduler_received section shows count for each type of messages scheduler received
- function_id_to_tasks section shows task count for each function used
- worker section shows worker details, you can use shortcuts to sort by columns, the char * on column header show which 
  column is sorted right now
  - agt_cpu/agt_rss means cpu/memory usage of worker agent
  - cpu/rss means cpu/memory usage of worker
  - free means number of free task slots for this worker
  - sent means how many tasks scheduler sent to the worker
  - queued means how many tasks worker received and queued
