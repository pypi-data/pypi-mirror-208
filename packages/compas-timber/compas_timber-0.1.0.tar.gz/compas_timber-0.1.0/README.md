# Installation
## One-click Installer 

> This script relies on the presence of a `compas_timber` and `compas_future` wheels in the same directory

This batch installer:
1. Downloads `miniconda` from [here](https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/)
2. Installs `miniconda`
3. Creates a new `conda` virtual environment with COMPAS and required dependencies
4. Installs `compas_future` from an offline wheel present in the same directory
4. Installs `compas_timber` from an offline wheel present in the same directory
5. Installs `compas_timber` components to the local `Rhino` installation
