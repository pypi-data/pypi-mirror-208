"""
This Program is used for making loadingbars,
and it can also make diffrent colors
like FAIL (red) or BLUE (blue)

mabye you have a part where the user waits a
specific amount of sek and to make it look
more alive you can use this as new output:

Loading: [#######    ] 60%

or this:

50%  [working]
