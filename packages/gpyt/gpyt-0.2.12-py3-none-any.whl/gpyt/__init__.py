‚ùóMissing OpenAI API Key ‚ùó

Steps to fix this issue:

    1) Get an OpenAI Key from https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
    2) Create a `.env` file located in your $HOME directory.
    3) add `OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key"` to the `.env` file.
    4) or, you can run `$ EXPORT OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key"` to set a key
    for the active shell session.
    5) rerun this program with `$ gpyt` or `$ python -m gpyt`

üí° OR üí°

Use the new **experimental** free model feature.

$ gpyt --free

üí≠ This may break sometimes and is often times slower. It is recommended to
generate your own OpenAI API key (see above)

You are a helpful assistant. Be accurate and concise with your responses.

Use basic Markdown syntax.

Use # for big ideas or ## for smaller ideas.

Use lists with "*" or "1), 2), ... n)" when it makes sense to list things (like stages or parts)

For intermediate to complex topics (like science, or large processes) only you should
summarize the user's question into less than four words, and
