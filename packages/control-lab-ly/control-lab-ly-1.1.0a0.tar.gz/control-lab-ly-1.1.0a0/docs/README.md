## Installation
Control.lab.ly can be found on PyPI and can be installed easily with `pip install`.
```shell
$ pip install control-lab-ly
```

## Basic Usage
Simple start-up guide for basic usage of the package.

### Import desired class
```python
from controllably.Move.Cartesian import Ender
mover = Ender(...)
mover.safeMoveTo((x,y,z))
```

More details for each class / module / package can be explored by using the `help` function.
```python
help(controllably.Move)   # help on package
help(Ender)               # help on class
help(mover)               # help on instance/object
```

Alternatively, you can use the native `pydoc` documentation generator.
```shell
$ python -m pydoc controllably.Move
```

>Tip: when using Interactive Python (IPython) (e.g. Jupyter notebooks), add a exclamation mark (`!`) in front of the shell command
```python
>>> !python -m pydoc controllably.Move
>>> !python -m pydoc -b   # Generates a static HTML site to browse package documentation
```
For basic usage, this is all you need to know. Check the documentation for more details on each respective class.

## Advanced Usage
For more advanced uses, Control.lab.ly provides a host of tools to streamline the development of lab equipment automation.

### 0. Import package
The convention is to import Control-lab-ly as `lab`.
```python
import controllably as lab
```

### Contents
1. Projects
2. Setups
3. Decks
4. Safety measures
5. Plugins

### 1. Creating a new project
Create a `/configs` folder in the base folder of your project repository to store all configuration related files from which the package will read from.\
This only has to be done once when you first set up the project folder.
```python
lab.create_configs()
```

A different address may be used by different machines for the same device. To manage the different addresses used by different machines, you first need your machine's unique identifier.
```python
# Get your machine's ID
print(lab.Helper.get_node())
```

A template of `registry.yaml` has also been added to the folder to hold the machine-specific addresses of your connected devices (i.e. COM ports).\
Populate the YAML file in the format shown below.
```yaml
### registry.yaml ###
'012345678901234':          # insert your machine's 15-digit ID here (from the above step)
    cam_index:              # camera index of the connected imaging devices
      __cam_01__: 1         # keep the leading and trailing double underscores
      __cam_02__: 0
    port:                   # addresses of serial COM ports
      __device_01__: COM3   # keep the leading and trailing double underscores
      __device_02__: COM16
```

To find the COM port address(es) of the device(s) that is/are currently connected to your machine, use:
```python
lab.Helper.get_ports()
```

### 2. Creating a new setup
Create a new folder for the configuration files of your new setup. If you had skipped the previous step of creating a project, calling `lab.create_setup()` will also generate the required file structure. However, be sure to populate your machine ID and device addresses in the `registry.yaml` file.

```python
lab.create_setup(setup_name = "_Setup01_")
# replace "_Setup01_" with the desired name for your setup
```
This creates a `/_Setup01_` folder that holds the configuration files for the setup, which includes `config.yaml` and `layout.json`.

#### 2.1 `config.yaml`
Configuration and calibration values for your devices is stored in `config.yaml`.\
Each configuration starts with the `name` of your device, then its `module`, `class`, and `settings`.
```yaml
_Device01_:                                     # name of simple device (user-defined)
  module: _module_name_01_                      # device module
  class: _submodule_1A_._class_1A_              # device class
  settings:
    port: __device_01__                         # port addresses defined in registry.yaml
    _setting_A_: {'tuple': [300,0,200]}         # use keys to define the type of iterable
    _setting_B_: {'array': [[0,1,0],[-1,0,0]]}  # only tuple and np.array supported
```

`Compound` devices are similarly configured. The configuration values for its component devices are defined under the `component_config` setting. The structure of the configuration values for the component devices are similar to that shown above, except indented to fall under the indentation of the `component_config` setting.
```yaml
_Device02_:                                 # name of 'Compound' device (user-defined)
  module: Compound                            
  class: _submodule_2A_._class_2A_
  settings:
    _setting_C_: 1                          # other settings for your 'Compound' device
    component_config:                       # nest component configuration settings here
      _Component01_:                        # name of component
        module: _module_name_03_
        class: _submodule_3A_._class_3A_
        settings:
          ip_address: '192.0.0.1'           # IP addresses do not vary between machines
      _Component02_: 
        module: _module_name_04_
        class: _submodule_4A_._class_4A_
        settings:
          _setting_D_: 2                    # settings for your component device
```

Lastly, you can define shortcuts to quickly access components of `Compound` devices.
```yaml
SHORTCUTS:
  _Nickname1_: '_Device02_._Component01_'
  _Nickname2_: '_Device02_._Component02_'
```

#### 2.2 `layout.json`
Layout configuration of your physical workspace (`Deck`) will be stored in `layout.json`. This package uses the same Labware files as those provided by [Opentrons](https://opentrons.com/), which can be found [here](https://labware.opentrons.com/), and custom Labware files can be created [here](https://labware.opentrons.com/create/). Labware files are JSON files that specifies the external and internal dimensions of a Labware block/object.

*Optional: if your setup does not involve moving objects around in a pre-defined workspace,  a layout configuration may not be required.*
```json
{
  "reference_points":{
    "1": ["_x01_","_y01_","_z01_"],
    "2": ["_x02_","_y02_","_z02_"]
  },
  "slots":{
    "1": {
      "name": "_Labware01_",
      "exclusion_height": -1,
      "filepath": "_repo_/.../_Labware01_.json"
    },
    "2": {
      "name": "_Labware02_",
      "exclusion_height": 0,
      "filepath": "_repo_/.../_Labware02_.json"
    },
    "3": {
      "name": "_Labware03_",
      "exclusion_height": 10,
      "filepath": "_repo_/.../_Labware03_.json"
    }
  }
}
```
In `reference_points`, the bottom-left coordinates of each slot in the workspace are defined. Slots are positions where Labware blocks may be placed.

In `slots`, the name of each slot and the file reference for Labware block that occupies that slot are defined. The filepath starts with the repository's base folder name.

The `exclusion_height` is the height (in mm) above the dimensions of the Labware block to steer clear from when performing move actions. Defaults to -1 (i.e. do not avoid).\
*(Note: only applies to final coordinates (i.e. destination). Does not guarantee collision avoidance when using point-to-point move actions. Use* `safeMoveTo()` *instead.)*

#### 2.3 Load setup
The initialisation of the setup occurs during the import `setup` from within `configs/_Setup01_`.

```python
# Add repository folder to sys.path
from pathlib import Path
import sys
REPO = '_repo_' 
# replace "_repo_" with your base directory for the project
ROOT = str(Path().absolute()).split(REPO)[0]
sys.path.append(f'{ROOT}{REPO}')

# Import the initialised setup
from configs._Setup01_ import setup
this = setup
this._Device01_
this._Nickname2_
```
With `this`, you can access all the devices that you have defined in `configs.yaml`.

### 3. Managing a deck
*Optional: if your setup does not involve moving objects around in a pre-defined workspace,  a* `Deck` *may not be required.*

#### 3.1 Loading a deck
To load the `Deck` from the layout file, use the `loadDeck()` function.
```python
from configs._Setup01_ import LAYOUT_FILE
this._Device02_.loadDeck(LAYOUT_FILE)
deck = this._Device02.deck
``` 

#### 3.2 Loading a Labware
To load the `Labware` into the `Deck`, use the `load_labware()` method.
```python
deck.load_labware(...)
``` 

### 4. Setting up safety measures
You can optionally set the safety policy for session. This has to be done before importing any of the classes.
```python
lab.set_safety('high')  # Pauses for input before every move action
lab.set_safety('low')   # Waits for countdown before every move action
# Import other classes from control-lab-ly only after setting the safety policy
```

### 5. Using plugins
User-defined plugins can be integrated into Control.lab.ly without making additions or modifications to the package itself. All classes and functions can be found in `lab.modules`.
```python
print(lab.modules)  
# view the entire package (only those that have been imported during the session)
lab.modules.Make.Something.Good.myClass
# this expression returns the registered class
```

#### 5.1 Directly registering a Class or Function
You can import the class and register the object using the `Factory.register()` function.
```python
from my_module import myClass
lab.Factory.register(myClass, "Make.Something.Good")
```

#### 5.2 Registering a Python module
Alternatively, you can automatically register all Classes and Functions in a Python module just by importing it.\
Declare a `__where__` global variable to indicate where to register the module.
```python
### my_module.py ###
__where__ = "Make.Something.Good"                 # Where to register this module to
# ==========
def myClass:                                      # Main body of code goes here
  ...
# ==========
from controllably import include_this_module      # Registers only the Classes and Functions
include_this_module()                             # defined above in this .py file
```
At the end of the .py file, import and call  the `include_this_module()` function.
