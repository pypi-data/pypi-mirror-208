What is lifelib?
-------------------

**lifelib** is a collection of open-source life actuarial models.
lifelib includes a variety of models, with sample scripts
and Jupyter notebooks to demonstrate how to use the models.

What for?
---------

lifelib models are highly versatile and transparent.
You can customize lifelib models and utilize them
in various practical areas, such as:

- Model validation / testing
- Pricing / profit testing
- Research / educational projects
- Valuation / cashflow projections
- Asset-liability modeling
- Risk and capital modeling
- Actuarial modernization to replace spreadsheet models


Why lifelib?
------------

lifelib models are built using `modelx`_, an open-source
Python package for building object-oriented models in Python.
By using lifelib, you can enjoy the following advantages:

* Models run fast!
* Formulas are easy to read
* Easy to trace formula dependency and errors
* Formulas are instantly evaluated
* Pandas and Numpy can be utilized
* Object-oriented
* Input from Excel and CSV files
* Documents can be integrated
* Formulas are saved in text files

Consequently, you can expect following benefits from
model development and governance perspectives:

- More efficient, transparent and faster model development
- Model integration with Python ecosystem (Pandas, Numpy, SciPy, etc..)
- Spreadsheet error elimination
- Better version control / model governance
- Automated model testing
