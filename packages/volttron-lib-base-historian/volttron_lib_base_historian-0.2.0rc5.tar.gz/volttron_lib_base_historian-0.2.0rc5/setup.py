VOLTTRON historian agents can be created by subclassing the [BaseHistorian class](https://github.com/eclipse-volttron/volttron-lib-base-historian/blob/develop/src/historian/base/base_historian.py) in this library.\n\n## Requirements\n\n - Python >= 3.10\n\n## Installation\n\nThis library can be installed using ```pip install volttron-lib-base-historian```. However, this is not necessary. Any \nhistorian agent that uses this library will automatically install it as part of its installation. For example, \ninstalling [SQLiteHistorian](https://github.com/eclipse-volttron/volttron-sqlitehistorian) will automatically install \nvolttron-lib-base-historian into the same python environment\n\n## Development\n\nPlease see the following for contributing guidelines [contributing](https://github.com/eclipse-volttron/volttron-core/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nPlease see the following helpful guide about [developing modular VOLTTRON agents](https://github.com/eclipse-volttron/volttron-core/blob/develop/DEVELOPING_ON_MODULAR.md)\n\n# Disclaimer Notice\n\nThis material was prepared as an account of work sponsored by an agency of the\nUnited States Government.
