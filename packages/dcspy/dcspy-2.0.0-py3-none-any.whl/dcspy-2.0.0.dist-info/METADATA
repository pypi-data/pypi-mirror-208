## DCSpy
DCSpy is able to pull information from DCS aircraft and display on Logitech G-series keyboards LCD.
It supports:
* Logitech device with 160x43 px (4 lines) monochrome LCD - **G13**, **G15 (v1 and v2)** and **G510**
* Logitech device with 320x240 px (8 lines) full RGBA LCD - **G19**

## Aircraft and instruments
* F/A-18C Hornet UFC - Up Front Controller
* F-16C Viper DED - Data Entry Display
* Ka-50 Black Shark II and III - PVI-800 and autopilot channels
* Mi-8MTV2 Hip - autopilot channels and Radios information
* Mi-24P Hind - Autopilot channels and modes and Radios information
* A-10C Warthog and A-10C II Tank Killer - Radio frequency information
* F-14A and F-14B Tomcat - basic support for RIO CAP

## Requirements
* [Logitech Gaming Software 9.04.49](https://support.logitech.com/software/lgs)
* [DCS-BIOS 0.7.48](https://github.com/DCSFlightpanels/dcs-bios/releases/latest) or newer (can be installed directly from DCSpy)
* DCS World: [2.8.4.39731](https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/en/news/changelog/openbeta/2.8.4.39731/) Open Beta (any release 2.8.* should work)
* (optional) [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/) but 3.7+ should be fine (with tcl/tk support, see [installation](https://github.com/emcek/dcspy/wiki/installation))

**Notes:**
* If you upgrade DCSpy from 1.5.1 or older you can safely remove Logitech LCD SDK from `C:\Program Files\Logitech Gaming Software\LCDSDK_8.57.148`. Since DCSpy version 1.6.0 use built-in SDK in LGS (Logitech Gaming Software).

## New ideas
I have lots of plans and new ideas how to improve it internally and form user's perspective, but don't hesitate to contact me. Maybe it will motivate me to implement some new stuff. Please open issue if you find bug or have any crazy idea.
