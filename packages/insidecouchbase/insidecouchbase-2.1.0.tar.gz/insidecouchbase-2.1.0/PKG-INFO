# Couchbase Complete Snapshot 

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/Couchbase%2C_Inc._official_logo.png)

InsideCouchbase is a Python library that allows you to analyze and monitor the health of a Couchbase cluster. With InsideCouchbase, you can perform health checks on your Couchbase cluster, check for missing or corrupted data, analyze bucket usage, and monitor cluster settings.

# Features
InsideCouchbase provides the following features:

- Analyze bucket usage: You can analyze the usage of a bucket to see how much data it contains, how many items it has, and how much memory it is using.

- Check cluster health: You can perform a health check on your Couchbase cluster to see if it is functioning properly.

- Check replication status: You can check the replication status of a bucket to see if it is properly replicating data to other nodes.

- Monitor cluster settings: You can monitor the settings of your Couchbase cluster to ensure that they are properly configured.

# Getting Started

1. Install the module

```bash
pip3 install insidecouchbase
```

2. Create a simple python script/module to utilize library.

```python
import couchbase

couchbaseInstance=couchbase.couchbaseNode('127.0.0.1','Administrator','test123')
```
Example results
