# gpt-cli

A simple command line utility for ChatGPT, written for personal use.

## Installing

To install:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="token" # preferably place this in .zshrc
pip install matteing-gpt-cli --user
which gpt-cli # to test your pip configuration
```

If your environment is set up to run CLI pip packages, the command-line should work just fine.
