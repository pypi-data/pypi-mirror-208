Description: # mopack
        **mopack** (pronounced "ammopack") is a *multiple origin* package manager, with
        an emphasis on C/C++ packages. It's designed to allow users to resolve package
        dependencies from multiple package managers ("origins").
        
        ## Why mopack?
        
        ### Separate abstract and concrete dependencies
        
        Generally speaking, developers of a project are more concerned about
        dependencies in the abstract: if your project requires Boost v1.50+, that's all
        that really matters. However, when building a project, you work with concrete
        dependencies: you naturally have to download a particular version of Boost and
        build/install it in a particular way. mopack supports this by letting a
        project's build system asking how to use (link to) an abstract dependency, which
        mopack will resolve via a particular concrete dependency.
        
        ### No configuration necessary
        
        If you've already downloaded and installed a project's dependencies, you usually
        don't need to do anything else. mopack can find dependencies using common
        methods for the relevant platform (e.g. pkg-config, searching system paths).
        
        ### Easy overrides
        
        To simplify building their project, developers can provide a default mopack
        configuration so that a standard build just works without any extra effort.
        However, people who *build* the project may prefer to resolve packages from
        somewhere else. mopack makes this easy: simply pass in an extra mopack file with
        new definitions for any dependency, and mopack will use those instead.
        
        ## Installation
        
        mopack uses [setuptools][setuptools], so installation is much the same as any
        other Python package:
        
        ```sh
        $ pip install mopack
        ```
        
        From there, you can start using mopack to build your software!
