Create a collage of album art from your ListenBrainz listening history.

## Overview

This is a simple pure-python command line tool which uses the ListenBrainz and MusicBrainz APIs to compile a collage of your scrobbled listening history. 

## Installation

This is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/lbcollage). It can be installed as follows:

```
> pip install lbcollage
```

If your path is configured correctly, the tool should be available to use from the command line immediately.

## Usage

The default behaviour of the script is to retrieve the last month of listening history. This is what happens when only a username is passed.

```
> lbcollage <username>
```

Different timespans and larger collages can be created using different specifiers. For example:

```
> lbcollage thumc -t year -s 5
```

Other options are available which can be listed using:

```
> lbcollage -h
```
