<h2>Overview</h1>

Do you love using a linter but want even more personalized rules? Building off a traditional lint, ITZMA offers additional features such as:

*  Enforcing all functions that change the state of the programs to begin with verbs
*  Enforcing all functions that return values to be nouns
*  Enforcing array names to be plural nouns
*  ... and more!

Of course, ITZMA also contains traditional features, such as:

* Enforcing all booleans to begin with pre-allowed verbs
* Enforcing consistent case types
* ... and more!

ITZMA is a linter that lets you decide how your code will look and helps you enforce those rules!

<h2>Installation and Usage</h1>

I'm excited to share Itzma with everyone!
To use Itzma locally, please install the following dependencies:
* flake8
* ast
* inflection
* nltk

Use the following command to install the dependencies:
```
pip install <library name>
```

To use Itzma to check your Python file, simply run the following in your terminal in the appropriate directory:

```
flake8  <filename>
```

A message will be printed for each Itzma check that was not passed!
For more information about Itzma checks and error messages, check out checks.py.
