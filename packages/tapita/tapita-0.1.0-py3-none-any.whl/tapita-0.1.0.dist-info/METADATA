# Tapita: a book cover generator

This is of very limited usefulness for the average person, but
if you have ever needed to generate book covers for a few 
thousand files out of book metadata, then this may be for you!

The image it generates has some colorful "art" thanks to [Dicebear](https://dicebear.com)
which, again, will not change unless you change the title or subtitle
of the book.

This is based off code from [Tenprintcover](https://github.com/mgiraldo/tenprintcover-py) 
although I don't think anything survives of the original code, which has been ported
to Pillow and de-c64-fied.

Usage:

```sh
$ python -m tapita --help
Usage: python -m tapita [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -t, --title <title>        Book title
  -s, --subtitle <subtitle>  Book subtitle
  -a, --author <author>      Book author
  -o, --output <filename>    Output file (- for stdout)
  --help                     Show this message and exit.

```

Example usage:

```sh
$ python -m tapita -t "Dunes" -s "Oh, worms!" -a "Frank Herbert (has no sons)" -o cover.jpg
```
Which produces this image:

There are plentiful opportunities for customization, which I will
probably not do anything about.

TODO: packaging and such.
