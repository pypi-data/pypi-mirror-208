## Command Line Interface
`hypebankapi` supports argparse for command line arguments:
```python
python -m hypebankapi -m EMAIL -b BIRTHDATE [-l LIMIT] [-v]
```
The module is invoked using the following command-line arguments:
- `-m EMAIL`, `--email EMAIL`: Specifies the email address. It is a required argument.
- `-b BIRTHDATE`, `--birthdate BIRTHDATE`: Specifies the birth date. It is a required argument.
- `-l LIMIT`, `--limit LIMIT`: Limit the number of transactions to fetch from Hype API. Default to 50. It is an optional argument.

## üöÄ Usage
```python
from hypebankapi import Hype, utils
from getpass import getpass

h = Hype()
h.login(EMAIL, getpass('Hype password: '), BIRTH-DATE) # Change EMAIL and BIRTH-DATE

# Wait for OTP code to arrive via SMS

h.otp2fa(input("OTP: "))

profile = h.get_profile()
balance = h.get_balance()
card = h.get_card()
movements = h.get_movements(limit=50) # change the limit of transactions fetched

utils.save_json(profile, 'profile.json')
