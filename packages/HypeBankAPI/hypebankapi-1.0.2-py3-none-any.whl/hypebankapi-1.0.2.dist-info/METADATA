# üåü HypeAPI

Unofficial Python module for interacting with the HYPE card API.

## üìù Notes
- HYPE only allows the use of one device at a time. Logging in with this module will disconnect you from the application and vice versa.

## Pypi
```python
pip install -U HypeBankAPI
```

## üöÄ Usage
```python
from hypebankapi import Hype, utils
from getpass import getpass

h = Hype()
h.login(EMAIL, getpass('Hype password: '), BIRTH-DATE) # Change EMAIL and BIRTH-DATE

# Wait for OTP code to arrive via SMS

h.otp2fa(input("OTP: "))

profile = h.get_profile()
balance = h.get_balance()
card = h.get_card()
movements = h.get_movements(limit=50) # change the limit of transactions fetched

utils.save_json(profile, 'profile.json')
utils.save_json(balance, 'balance.json')
utils.save_json(card, 'card.json')
utils.save_json(movements, 'movements.json')
```
