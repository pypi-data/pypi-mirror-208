## Motivation

![oobabot in action!](./docs/oobabot.png "discord action shot")

Text-generative UIs are cool to run at home, and Discord is fun to mess with your friends.  Why not combine the two and have something awesome!

Real motivation: I wanted a chatbot in my discord that would act like my cat.  A "catbot" if you will.

## Features

| **`oobabot`**  | how that's awesome |
|---------------|------------------|
| **user-supplied persona** | you supply the persona on how would like the bot to behave |
| **multiple converations** | can track multiple conversational threads, and reply to each in a contextually appropriate way |
| **watchwords** | can monitor all channels in a server for one or more wakewords or @-mentions |
| **private conversations** | can chat with you 1:1 in a DM |
| **good Discord hygiene** | splits messages into independent sentences, pings the author in the first one |
| **low-latency** | streams the reply live, sentence by sentence.  Provides lower latency, especially on longer responses. |
| **stats** | track token generation speed, latency, failures and usage |
| **easy networking** | connects to discord from your machine using websockets, so no need to expose a server to the internet |
| âœ¨**Stable Diffusion** | new in v0.1.4!  Optional image generation with AUTOMATIC1111 |

Discord bot for oobabooga's text-generation-webui

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

Discord Settings:
  --history-lines HISTORY_LINES
                        Number of lines of history to supply to the AI. This is the number
                        of lines of history that the AI will see when generating a response.
                        The default is 20.
  --ignore-dms          If set, the bot will ignore direct messages.
  --wakewords [WAKEWORDS ...]
                        One or more words that the bot will listen for. The bot will listen
                        in all discord channels can access for one of these words to be
                        mentioned, then reply to any messages it sees with a matching word.
                        The bot will always reply to @-mentions and direct messages, even if
                        no wakewords are supplied.

Oobabooga Seetings:
  --ai-name AI_NAME     Name of the AI to use for requests. This can be whatever you want,
                        but might make sense to be the name of the bot in Discord.
  --base-url BASE_URL   Base URL for the oobabooga instance. This should be
                        ws://hostname[:port] for plain websocket connections, or
                        wss://hostname[:port] for websocket connections over TLS.
  --log-all-the-things  Prints all oobabooga requests and responses in their entirety to
                        STDOUT
  --persona PERSONA     This prefix will be added in front of every user-supplied request.
                        This is useful for setting up a 'character' for the bot to play.
                        Alternatively, this can be set with the OOBABOT_PERSONA environment
                        variable.

Stable Diffusion Settings:
  --diffusion-steps DIFFUSION_STEPS
                        Number of diffusion steps to take when generating an image. The
                        default is 30.
  --image-height IMAGE_HEIGHT
                        Size of images to generate. This is the height of the image in
                        pixels. The default is 512.
  --image-width IMAGE_WIDTH
                        Size of images to generate. This is the width of the image in
                        pixels. The default is 512.
  --image-words [IMAGE_WORDS ...]
                        One or more words that will indicate the user is requeting an image
                        to be generated.
  --stable-diffusion-sampler STABLE_DIFFUSION_SAMPLER, --sd-sampler STABLE_DIFFUSION_SAMPLER
                        Sampler to use when generating images. If not specified, the one set
                        on the AUTOMATIC1111 server will be used.
  --stable-diffusion-url STABLE_DIFFUSION_URL, --sd-url STABLE_DIFFUSION_URL
                        URL for an AUTOMATIC1111 Stable Diffusion server
  --sd-negative-prompt SD_NEGATIVE_PROMPT
                        Negative prompt to use when generating images. This will discourage
                        Stable Diffusion from generating images with the specified content.
                        By default, this is set to follow Discord's TOS.
  --sd-negative-prompt-nsfw SD_NEGATIVE_PROMPT_NSFW
                        Negative prompt to use when generating images in a channel marked
                        as'Age-Restricted'.

Also, to authenticate to Discord, you must set the environment variable: DISCORD_TOKEN =
<your bot's discord token>
```

## Required settings

- **`DISCORD_TOKEN`** environment variable

   Set your shell environment's **`DISCORD_TOKEN`** to token Discord provided when you set up the bot account.  It should be something like a 72-character-long random-looking string.

    **bash example**

    ``` bash
    export DISCORD_TOKEN=___YOUR_TOKEN___
    ```

    **fish example**

    ``` fish
    set -Ux DISCORD_TOKEN ___YOUR_TOKEN___
    ```

- **`--base-url`**

    The base URL of oobabooga's streaming web API.  This is
    required if the oobabooga machine is different than where you're running **`oobabot`**.

    By default, this will be port 5005 (even though the HTML UI runs on a different port).  The protocol should typically be ws://.

    All together, this should look something like:

    ```bash
    --base-url ws://localhost:5005
    ```

   This is also the default value, but any other setting should follow the same form.

## Optional settings

- **`--ai-name`**

   the name the AI will be instructed to call itself.  Note that this technically doesn't need to be the same as the bot in your discord, but it would likely make sense to your users if they are at least similar.

- **`--wakewords`**

   one or more words that the bot will look for.  It will reply to any message which contains one of these words, in any channel.

## Persona: the fun setting

- **`--persona`**

    is a short few sentences describing the role your bot should act as.  For instance, this is the setting I'm using for my cat-bot, whose name is "Rosie".

```console
Here is some background information about Rosie:
- You are Rosie
- You are a cat
- Rosie is a female cat
- Rosie is owned by Chris, whose nickname is xxxxxxx
- Rosie loves Chris more than anything
- You are 9 years old
- You enjoy laying on laps and murder
- Your personality is both witty and profane
- The people in this chat room are your friends
```

Persona may be set from the command line with the **`--persona`** argument.

Alternatively, it can be set through the environment variable **`OOBABOT_PERSONA`**.

## Then, run it

You should see something like this if everything worked:

![oobabot running!](./docs/oobabot-cli.png "textually interesting image")

---

## Stable Diffusion via AUTOMATIC1111

- **`--stable-diffusion-url`**

  is the URL to a server running [AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui)

  With it, users can ask **`oobabot`** to generate images and post the
  results to the channel.  The user who made the original request can
  choose to regenerate the image as they like.  If they either don't
  find one they like, or don't do anything within 3 minutes, the image
  will be removed.

  ![oobabot running!](./docs/zombietaytay.png "textually interesting image")

  Currently, detection of photo requests is very crude, and is only looking
  for messages which match this regex:

  ```python
        photowords = ["drawing", "photo", "pic", "picture", "image", "sketch"]
        self.photo_patterns = [
            re.compile(
                r"^.*\b" + photoword + r"\b[\s]*(of|with)?[\s]*[:]?(.*)$", re.IGNORECASE
            )
            for photoword in photowords
        ]
  ```

  Note that depending on the checkpoint loaded in Stable Diffusion, it may not be appropriate
  for your server's community.  I suggest reviewing [Discord's Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) and
  [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines) before deciding what checkpoint to run.

  **`oobabot`** supports two different negative prompts, depending on whether the channel
  is marked as "Age-Restricted" or not.  This is to allow for more explicit content in
  channels which are marked as such.  While the negative prompt will discourage Stable
  Diffusion from generating an image which matches the prompt, but is not foolproof.

---

## Interacting with **`oobabot`**

By default, **`oobabot`** will listen for three types of messages in the servers it's connected to:

 1. any message in which **`oobabot`**'s account is @-mentioned
 1. any direct message
 1. any message containing a provided wakeword (see Optional Settings)

Also, the bot has a random chance of sending follow-up messages within the
same channel if others reply within 120 seconds of its last post.  The exact
parameters for this are in flux, but is meant to simulate a natural conversation
flow, without forcing others to always post a wakeword.

## Known Issues

- detection of requests for photos is very crude, and will likely be improved in the future.
- some of the default settings are very specific to my use case, and will likely be made
  configurable in the future
- sometimes the bot wants to continue conversations on behalf of other members of the chatroom.  I have some hacks in place to notice and truncate this behavior, but it can lead to terse responses on occasion.
