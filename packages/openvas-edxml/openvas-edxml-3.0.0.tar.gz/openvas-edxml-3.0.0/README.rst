This is an EDXML_ transcoder that takes OpenVAS_ XML reports as input and outputs EDXML data.

The resulting EDXML data enables machines to learn a lot about a networking environment, automatically correlate
vulnerability data with other security data and reason about it. Details can be found in `this document <transcoder.rst>`_,
which contains a description of the transcoder generated by the transcoder itself.

The transcoder was developed at Northwave_ to process vulnerability data at its Security Operations Center.
As such, it has been used to process scans for a wide range of organizations, both large and small ones.

INSTALLING
----------

You can install this transcoder using pip::

    pip install openvas-edxml

BASIC USAGE INSTRUCTIONS
------------------------

Transcoding an OpenVAS report is done using a command similar to::

    openvas-edxml -f /path/to/openvas-report.xml

Running this command will generate EDXML data on standard output. In case that does not yield
anything (no events) it might be that your OpenVAS report is wrapped in a ``<get_reports_response>``
tag. In that case, use the ``--have-response-tag`` command line flag. Full command line options can be
obtained by running::

    openvas-edxml -h
