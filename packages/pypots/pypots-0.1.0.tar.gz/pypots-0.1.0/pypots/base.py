class BaseModel(ABC):
    """The base model class for all model implementations.

    Parameters
    ----------
    device : str or `torch.device`, default = None,
        The device for the model to run on.
        If not given, will try to use CUDA devices first (will use the GPU with device number 0 only by default),
        then CPUs, considering CUDA and CPU are so far the main devices for people to train ML models.
        Other devices like Google TPU and Apple Silicon accelerator MPS may be added in the future.

    saving_path : str, default = None,
        The path for automatically saving model checkpoints and tensorboard files (i.e. loss values recorded during
        training into a tensorboard file). Will not save if not given.

    model_saving_strategy : str or None, None or "best" or "better" , default = "best",
        The strategy to save model checkpoints. It has to be one of [None, "best", "better"].
        No model will be saved when it is set as None.
        The "best" strategy will only automatically save the best model after the training finished.
        The "better" strategy will automatically save the model during training whenever the model performs
        better than in previous epochs.

    Attributes
    ----------
    model : object, default = None,
        The underlying model or algorithm to finish the task.

    summary_writer : None or torch.utils.tensorboard.SummaryWriter,  default = None,
        The event writer to save training logs. Default as None. It only works when parameter `tb_file_saving_path` is
        given, otherwise the training events won't be saved.

        It is designed as being set up while initializing the model because it's created to
        1). help visualize the model's training procedure (during training not after) and
        2). assist users to tune the model's hype-parameters.
        If only setting it up after training with a function like setter(), it cannot achieve the 1st purpose.
