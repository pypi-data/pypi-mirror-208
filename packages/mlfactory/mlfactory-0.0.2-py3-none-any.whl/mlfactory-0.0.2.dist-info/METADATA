About
=====
***mlfactory*** is a simple modular wrapper library that abstracts several different types of neural network architectures and techniques for computer vision (pytorch and tensorflow backend) providing seemless easy to use training in a few lines of code. 

Using the standard modular philosophy you can also define your own neural network in pytorch/tensorflow, and if youre lazy to write the data loaders or the training loop then pass the network to our submodules !, or vice versa.
