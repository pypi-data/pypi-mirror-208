<h5 align="center"> <i>A dependency vulnerability scanner for your python projects, straight from the terminal.</i> </h5>

+ 🚀 blazingly fast and efficient scanner that can be used to scan large projects fairly quickly.
+ 🤖 automatically uses `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml` or straight from the source code (though not reccomended)
+ 🧑‍💻 easy to use, and can be integrated into existing build processes.
+ 💽 In its very early alpha stage, so some features may not work correctly. PRs and issue makers welcome.

## 🕊️ Install

```bash
pip install pyscan
```

or

```bash
cargo install pyscan
```

or check out the [releases](https://github.com/aswinnnn/pyscan/releases).

## 🐇 Usage

Go to your python source directory (or wherever you keep your requirements.txt/pyproject.toml) and run:

```bash
pyscan
```
or
```bash
pyscan -d path/to/src
```

that should get the thing going.
Here's the order of precedence for a "source" file:

+ requirements.txt
+ pyproject.toml
+ your python source code (.py) [highly not reccomended]

Any dependencies without a specified version defaults to its latest stable version. **Make sure you version-ize your requirements** and use proper [pep-508 syntax](https://peps.python.org/pep-0508/).

## 🦀 Note

pyscan uses [OSV](https://osv.dev) as its database for now. There are plans to add a few more.

pyscan doesn't make sure your code is safe from everything. Use all resources available to you like Dependabot and other github features.

## 🐰 Todo

- [x] get it working.
- [ ] add  tests.
- [ ] more advisory databases.
- [ ] query individual dependencies.
- [ ] perfomance optimizations.

While not coding, I am a broke high school student with nothing else to do. I appreciate all the help I'm worthy of.
