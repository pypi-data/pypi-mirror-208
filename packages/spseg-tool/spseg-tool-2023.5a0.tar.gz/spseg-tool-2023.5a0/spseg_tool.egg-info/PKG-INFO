# SP-SEG: Proof of concept tool for manual segmentation by spheripixel projection
In this repository, you can find a proof of concept of the tool for manual point cloud labeling by spherical point-pixel projection.

## ‚ùó Limitations
The current version is just the proof of concept version.

## üîß Environment and installation
```python
python >= 3.10
```
Required packages:
```python
"PyQt5",
"Pillow",
"numpy",
"pydantic",
"scikit-learn",
"scipy",
"colormath",
"tqdm",
"toml"
```

To install the software:
1. Clone the repository and run inside:
```bash
pip install .
```
1. Or use:
```bash
pip install sp-seg
```

> If you're experiencing issues with installing the package, install firstly the dependencies:
> ```bash
> pip install PyQt5 Pillow numpy pydantic scikit-learn scipy colormath tqdm toml
> ```

Then, you can run the software with the command:
```bash
D:\>spseg
```

1. [Changing mask opacity](#changing-mask-opacity)
1. [Accepting an object](#accepting-an-object)
1. [Saving segmentation result](#saving-segmentation-result)


### Starting the application
Having installed the application, just run the following command in the command line:
```bash
D:\>spseg
```
### Opening a point cloud
To open a point cloud, click `Open` icon in the toolbar and choose a proper file.
> ‚ùó At the moment only PTS files are supported 

> ‚ùó If you need to change the columns meaning of PTS opener, modify the `opener.column` key of the config file. Currently interpretable letters are `X`, `Y`, `Z`, `R`, `G`, and `B`

### Loading labels definition
To open labels click the proper icon in the toolbar and choose the JSON file with labels definitions.
Example labels definition may look like below:

```json
[
  {
    "label": "ceiling",
    "code": 0,
    "color": [4, 255, 0]
  },
  {
    "label": "floor",
    "code": 1,
    "color": [255, 128, 0]
  }
]
```

### Zooming in and out
For easier detail selection you can zoom in and zoom out. To do so keep `Ctrl` pressed and use mouse wheel.

### Depth preview
Sometimes, it may be useful to get insight into depth distribution. To see the depth map, just press `Alt` button.

### Depth scale
To change $\gamma$ of the depth map, use `+` or `-` buttons while `Alt` is pressed.

### Vertical roll
To roll the scene vertically, press `Q` button.

### Horizontal roll
To roll the scene horizontally, press `W` button.

### Object segmentation
To segment an object, choose the proper category in the menu of the left and start selecting the polygon.
To add a vertex to the polygon, use left mouse button. If you want to close a polygon, click right mouse button.

> ‚ùó Closing polygon creates an edge between the first and the last added vertex!

> ‚ùó You don't need to select the entire object using a single polygon. You can draw as many polygons for an object as you wish, until the object segmentation will be accepted by pressing `F1` button.

### Deselecting region
You can deselect fragments of scene selected by mistake. To do so, check the mode to `Deselect` (radio button in the tollbar) or use `Caps Lock` button.
For deselecting you also draws a polygon.

> ‚ùó Remember to change the mode to `Select` when you already deselected the desired points.

### Changing mask opacity

To change the opacity of the mask of currently segmented object, use the slider just below the toolbar.

### Accepting an object
When you finish the object segmentation you need to accept the instance of the category by clicking `F1` button.

### Saving segmentation result
To save the PTS result, choose the proper icon in the toolbar menu.

## üèéÔ∏è Further development
- [ ] code optimization
- [ ] code cleaning
- [ ] add handling other point cloud formats
- [ ] handle non-single-setup point clouds
- [ ] enable saving draft segmentation result
