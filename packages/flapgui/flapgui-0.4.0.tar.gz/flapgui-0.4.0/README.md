# FlapGUI
Flap (Framework for making Lightweight and Automatic Programs) is a GUI framework for creating cross-platform GUI applications easily using Tkinter. 
# Purpose
FlapGUI is designed to make writing GUI applications as simple as possible, eliminating the learning curve for making functional programs. 

Most GUI frameworks (tkinter, qt, gtk, etc.) have a steep learning curve, which FlapGUI intends to fix.

**Flap is in beta and is not complete. It is subject to rapid and signigicant change at the moment.**

# Tutorial
Coming soon.

The framework is continually evolving and is regularly changed in a major way.

In the meantime, the framework will not have a tutorial.
