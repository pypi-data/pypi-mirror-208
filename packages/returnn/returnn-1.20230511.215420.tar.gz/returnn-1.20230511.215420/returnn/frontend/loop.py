While loop.

Why did we choose this API?
To allow for both eager-based and graph-based frameworks,
and also to avoid any magic happening here.

    Extended variant of :func:`while_loop`.

    Supports iterating over a given axis (spatial_dim),
    supports iterating over some input tensors (xs: X) on the given axis,
    and supports returning some frame-accumulated output tensors (ys: Y).

    :param spatial_dim: if None or unknown, need to provide cond. must be given if xs is not None.
    :param cond_dims: if spatial_dim is not given, this must be given to know what shape to expect from cond.
        This will also be the shape of the dyn_size_ext of the resulting spatial_dim.
    :param initial: state/carry
    :param xs: input, will be unstacked over spatial_dim. can be None.
    :param ys: output, as templates, per iteration (excluding spatial_dim)
    :param cond: if spatial_dim is None/unknown, need to provide this.
        The shape will be the same as the dyn_size_ext of the resulting spatial_dim.
        Unlike while_loop cond, does not need to be scalar. E.g. some shape like [B] is normal.
        Once it returns False for all entries, the loop will stop.
        Once it returns False for some entry, further values in further iterations for this entry will be ignored.
    :param body:
    :param max_seq_len: If given, it is checked in addition to `cond`, and when reached, it stops the loop.
    :param return_tensor_arrays: if True, will return TensorArray instead of Tensor for ys.
        Internally, we work with TensorArray anyway, so this avoids the final stack().
        In case of beam search, it might make more sense
        to perform some post-processing on the TensorArray per entry,
        like selecting the right beam entries.
