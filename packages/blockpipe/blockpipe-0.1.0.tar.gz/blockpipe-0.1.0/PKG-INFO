# Blockpipe Client for Python

Blockpipe Client is a Python library for interacting with Blockpipe Endpoint API. It provides a simple interface for fetching data from the API and supports both single endpoint and multiple endpoints.

## Installation

Install the package using pip:

```bash
pip install blockpipe
```

## Usage

1.  Import `BlockpipeClient` and create a new instance:

```python

from blockpipe import BlockpipeClient

client = BlockpipeClient('<PROJECT_SLUG>', 
    environment='production', # optional
    base_url='https://app.blockpipe.io/endpoint', # optional
)
```

2.  Fetch data from the Blockpipe Endpoint API:

```python
results = client.get(['/path1', '/path2'])
```

# or with a single endpoint

```python
result = client.get('/path1')
```

3.  Use the fetched data in your application:

```python
for result in results:
    print(result)

# If you only requested one endpoint, you can access the data directly:
print(result)
```
