## Traversaal

Traversaal is a Python package that provides a simple semantic search functionality for hotel data. It leverages large language models such as BERT to encode hotel descriptions and reviews, allowing users to perform semantic search queries and retrieve relevant results based on the provided search query.

## Features

- Efficient semantic search for hotel data based on descriptions and reviews.
- Utilizes state-of-the-art language models to encode and compare text embeddings.
- Returns relevant search results with corresponding scores for ranking.
- Supports GPU acceleration for faster encoding and search performance.

## Installation

You can install Traversaal using pip:

```bash
pip install traversaal

import pandas as pd
import traversaal

model_name = 'bert-base-uncased'
search = traversaal.SemanticSearch(model_name)

# Load your hotel data into a DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv('hotels.csv')

# Define the search query
query = 'great location and service'

# Perform the semantic search
results = search.search(df, query)

# Print the top results
print(results.head())
