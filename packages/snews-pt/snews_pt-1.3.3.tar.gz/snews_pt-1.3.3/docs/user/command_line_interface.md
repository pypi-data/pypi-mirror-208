# Command Line Interface (CLI)

It is also possible to interact with `snews_pt` through the command line. <br>
All the commands have their short descriptions accessible via `--help` flag. 
```bash
(venv) User$: snews_pt --help 
```
```bash
Usage: snews_pt [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...
  User interface for snews_pt tools

Options:
  --version   Show the version and exit.
  --env TEXT  environment file containing the configurations  [default: (auxiliary/test-config.env)]
  --help      Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  heartbeat       Publish heartbeat messages.
  message-schema  Display the message format for `tier`, default 'all'
  publish         Publish a message using snews_pub
  retract         Retract N latest message
  subscribe       Subscribe to Alert topic 
```
The main command `snews_pt` serves an entry point. It is also possible to set an _environment_ by passing it to this with any other command. 
E.g. `snews_pt --env myenvfile.env subscribe` will set the variables in _myenvfile.env_  and subscribe to the _ALERT_TOPIC_ specified in this file. <br>
By default, it uses the environment file that comes with the package.

## Subscribing to Alert Topics
The subscription command can be called without any arguments.
```bash 
(venv) User$: snews_pt subscribe 
```
```bash
> You are subscribing to ALERT 
> Broker:kafka://kafka.scimma.org/snews.alert-test
```
---
## Message Schemas
`snews_pt message-schema` can tell you the required contents for each tiers. You can display the contents of a single tier by calling e.g.
```bash
(venv) User$: snews_pt message-schema time
```
In which case it displays the following
```bash
         >The Message Schema for TimeTier 
_id                 :(SNEWS SETS)
detector_name       :(SNEWS SETS)
sent_time           :(SNEWS SETS)
machine_time        :(User Input)
neutrino_time       :(User Input)
timing_series       :(User Input)  
```
or you can simply call `snews_pt message-schema` without any positional arguments in which case it displays all the message schemes. <br>

## Publishing Observation Messages
User can publish observation messages to one of the 'CoincidenceTier', 'TimeTier', or 'SigTier'. It is also possible to publish _Heartbeat_ and _Retraction_ messages, see respective section below.

To publish one or more tier user can request arbitrary number of tiers in one line
```bash
(venv) User$: snews_pt publish coincidence time time significance s
```
The `publish` tool takes all the request and queries known aliases e.g. `s` is accepted as `SignificanceTier`, and returns a list of unique requested tiers.<br>
Without any additional _options_ this by default publishes a dummy observation to each of the requested tiers with their required data fields.

For a more realistic case, we would want to submit a message that is saved by our experiment as a _json_ file. This can be passed with a `--file` (or `-f`) flag.
```bash
(venv) User$: snews_pt publish coincidence -f my_coincidence_message.json
```
There are several dummy examples [here](../test/) that can be used as a reference. In principle, SNEWS only accept specific fields (see `snews_pt message-schema`), however the tools does not fail if you provide additional arguments. It kindly warns you about them and publishes the remaining parts.

Try publishing the following file which contains an `extra_key` field.
```bash
(venv) User$: snews_pt publish coincidence -f snews_pt/test/example_coincidence_tier_message.json
```

It should give the following
```bash
Requested tiers are;
                > CoincidenceTier
Publishing to CoincidenceTier;
extra_key not a valid key for CoincidenceTier
---------------------------------------------------------
_id                 :0_CoincidenceTier_22/01/01_20:19:06:356690
detector_name       :TEST
sent_time           :22/01/01 20:19:06
machine_time        :test machine time
neutrino_time       :test nu time
p_value             :test p-values 
```

## Publishing Heartbeat messages

`snews_pt heartbeat`  can be used to publish heartbeat messages. It is up to the user to invoke this function with a desired frequency, however it is recommended to publish heartbeats consistently and with couple of minutes intervals.

The `heartbeat` command takes a `status` argument which can either be 'ON' or 'OFF'. 
Additionaly, `machine_time` can be passed using `--machine_time` (`-mt`) flag as a string. Each heartbeat message is appended with a `sent_time`, if machine time is also provided, the latency can be tracked.

```bash
(venv) User$: snews_pt heartbeat ON -mt '22/01/01 20:19:06' --verbose False
```
---

## Retraction Messages

It can happen that user publishes a message by accident or with wrong input. In these cases `snews_pt` allows for retraction messages. <br>
While the specific message id can be passed, it is also possible to publish a retraction message for the last `n` number of messages. This

```bash
(venv) User$: snews_pt retract --tier Coinc -n 3 --reason 'daq failure' 
```
