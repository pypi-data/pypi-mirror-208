The python package `bfcm` includes the functions related to the journal paper "Modeling Implicit Bias with Fuzzy Cognitive Maps" by Gonzalo Nápoles, Isel Grau, Leonardo Concepción, Lisa Koutsoviti Koumeri and João Paulo Papa (see here https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2022.01.070).

The functions have been introduced in the papers "Modeling implicit bias with fuzzy cognitive maps" (Nápoles et al., 2022) and "Measuring Implicit Bias Using SHAP Feature Importance and Fuzzy Cognitive Maps" (Grau et al., 2023). Apart from the Fuzzy Cognitive Map method, an additional method included is using clustering to automatically discover the groups describing a numeric feature, which allows computing the association between numeric and categorical features using Cramer\'s V coefficient',
