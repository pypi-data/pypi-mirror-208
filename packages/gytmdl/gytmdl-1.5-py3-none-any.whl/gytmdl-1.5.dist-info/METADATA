# Glomatico's YouTube Music Downloader
Download YouTube Music songs/albums/playlists with tags from YouTube Music in 256kbps AAC/128kbps Opus/128kbps AAC.

## Why not just use yt-dlp directly?
While this project uses yt-dlp under the hood to download songs from YouTube Music, it has the advantage of utilizing [YouTube Music's API](https://github.com/sigma67/ytmusicapi) to get songs metadata, ensuring that you get the correct tags for your songs. This includes information such as track number, square cover, lyrics, year, etc.

## Setup
1. Install Python 3.8 or higher
2. Install gytmdl with pip
    ```
    pip install gytmdl
    ```
3. Add FFMPEG to your PATH. You can get it from here: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
    * If you are on Windows you can move the `ffmpeg.exe` file to the same folder that you will run the script instead of adding it to your PATH.
4. (optional) Get your cookies.txt
    * With cookies.txt, you can download age restricted tracks, private playlists and songs in 256kbps AAC using `--itag 141` argument if you are a premium user. You can export your cookies by using the following Google Chrome extension on YouTube Music website with your account logged in: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gdocmgbfkjnnpapoeobnolbbkoibbcif. Make sure to export it as `cookies.txt` to the same folder that you will run the script.
