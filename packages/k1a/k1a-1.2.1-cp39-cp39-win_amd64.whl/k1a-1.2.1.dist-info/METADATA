# k1a

This is a supplementary library to [k1lib](https://k1lib.com) that accelerates a lot of its functionalities by compiling to C directly. As a consequence, you won't/shouldn't use this library directly.

# Installation

Just do this:

```
pip install k1lib[extras]
```

If you only want to install this alone, for whatever reason, then do this:

```
pip install k1a
```
