Use the following schema:

Action:\\ newline required here  
string \\ The action to take. Must be one of {tool_names}

Input: \\ newline required here
string \\ The input to the action


**Option #2:**
Use this if you want to respond directly to me. 
Particularly if you think you have succeeded in doing what I want, or answered the question,
or if you are not sure what I asked from you.
Use the following schema:

Action:     \\ newline required here 
FinalAnswer \\ The final action

Input: \\ newline required here
string \\ You should put what you want to return to the human here

Notes: 
- Please choose the FinalAnswer action if you have answered the question or performed the task, or if you have determined that you can't.

Okay, so what is the response to my last comment? If using information obtained from the tools 
you must mention it explicitly without mentioning the tool names - I have forgotten all TOOL RESPONSES! 
If the tool failed, use the tool's response to refine your tool's request, try something else, 
or stop by giving a final answer. 
Remember to to respond with the schema described above, and NOTHING else.
