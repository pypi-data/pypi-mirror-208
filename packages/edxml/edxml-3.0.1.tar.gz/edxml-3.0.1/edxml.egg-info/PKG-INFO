EDXML_ is a data representation that transforms arbitrary data records into stories
that machines can read and understand. Computers can read EDXML documents similar to
how humans read a novel. This enables computers to actively assist human analysts
in making sense of data, correlate data from multiple sources and connect the dots.

This repository contains the **EDXML Software Development Kit (SDK)**. The
SDK features the edxml Python package, which contains an implementation of the
`EDXML specification <http://edxml.org/spec>`_. It also offers some command line
tools to inspect EDXML documents and aid in application development.

The package can be installed using Pip::

    pip install edxml
