To use this library, you will need to have a GetTestMail account. If you don't have one, you can sign up for a free [account](https://gettestmail.com).

## Installation

client = GetTestMailClient("your-api-key")
test_mail = client.create_new()
print(test_mail.emailAddress)

# This will wait for a message to be received up until expires_at time
test_mail = client.wait_for_message(test_mail.id)
print(test_mail.message)

```
