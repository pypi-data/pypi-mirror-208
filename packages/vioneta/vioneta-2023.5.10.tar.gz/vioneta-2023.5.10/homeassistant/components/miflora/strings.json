      "description": "The Mi Flora integration stopped working in Vioneta Agro 2022.7 and replaced by the Xiaomi BLE integration in the 2022.8 release.\n\nThere is no migration path possible, therefore, you have to add your Mi Flora device using the new integration manually.\n\nYour existing Mi Flora YAML configuration is no longer used by Vioneta Agro. Remove the YAML configuration from your configuration.yaml file and restart Vioneta Agro to fix this issue."
